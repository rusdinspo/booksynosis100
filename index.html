Hinduism, one of the most ancient of all belief systems, is increasingly well known in the West through expatriate Indian communities. Taoism has been an important influence on Western thinking, especially through the impact of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em>. Confucianism, less metaphysical in its principles, emphasizes family values and the role of the individual within the state. And Shinto, distinctively Japanese in character, is the most animistic of the great religions, based on a belief in numerous individual spirits. The contributors explore a great variety of topics within these religions, including: the life of the Buddha; <em>karma</em> and rebirth; inspiring teachers and <em>gurus</em>; the life of Confucius; sacred Taoist texts; the epics of the <em>Ramayana</em> and <em>Mahabharata</em>; holy landscapes, shrines, and festivals; enlightenment; and--for all the faiths--the spiritual and ethical teachings, art and architecture, sacred writings, ritual and ceremony, and death and the afterlife.<br> <br> Also included are extracts from or summaries of historical texts, with author commentaries that explain the significance of each piece and place in its full context. Authoritative and accessible, <em>Eastern Religions</em> provides a gateway for all those in the West who wish to move one step closer to the spirit of the East.</p><p><br><strong>Michael D.

(Crucial Questions)</h2><p><p>The Good Samaritan. The Prodigal Son. The Pearl of Great Price. Jesus was well known for using parables to illustrate a point. These short stories can be simple enough for a child to understand, yet they are also profound and have left many puzzled about their meaning.</p><p>In this booklet, Dr. R.C. Sproul walks through eleven of Jesus&#x2019; parables and the rich lessons they carry for us today. Dr. Sproul also explains how parables worked to clarify Jesus&#x2019; message for some&#x2014;and to conceal it from others.</p><p>The Crucial Questions booklet series by Dr. R.C. Sproul offers succinct answers to important questions often asked by Christians and thoughtful inquirers.</p></p><p><p>Dr. R.C. Sproul (1939&#x2013;2017) was founder of Ligonier Ministries, an international Christian discipleship organization located near Orlando, Fla.

Now, faced with the new challenges of our unpredictable global business environment, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner--two of the country&#39;s premier leadership experts--have completely revised and updated their classic book. Building on the knowledge base of their previous books, the third edition of The Leadership Challenge is grounded in extensive research and based on interviews with all kinds of leaders at all levels in public and private organizations from around the world. In this edition, the authors emphasize that the fundamentals of leadership are the same today as they were in the 1980s, and as they&#39;ve probably been for centuries. In that sense, nothing&#39;s new. Leadership is not a fad. While the content of leadership has not changed, the context has-and in some cases, changed dramatically.</p><p>In the 1980s and again in the '90s, James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner published <i>The Leadership Challenge</i> to address issues they uncovered in research on ordinary people achieving "individual leadership standards of excellence." The keys they identified--model the way, inspire a shared vision, challenge the process, enable others to act, encourage the heart--have now been reexamined in the context of the post-millennium world and updated in a third edition. "What we have discovered, and rediscovered, is that leadership is not the private reserve of a few charismatic men and women," write Kouzes, chairman emeritus of the Tom Peters Company, and Posner, dean of the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University. "People make extraordinary things happen by liberating the leader within everyone." After explaining their concept and methodology, the authors detail the five essentials noted above in a pair of chapters apiece that bring clarity to their theories with case studies and recommended actions. The specificity of each (motivating through "the meaningfulness of the challenge, not the material rewards of success," for example, and being able to "accept the mistakes that result from experimentation") is enhanced by advice on sustaining the commitment and making leadership skills accessible to all. The results remain as relevant as when they were first published. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>More Than One Million People Have Taken The Leadership Challenge<br> Here's Why . . .<br> <br> "This book is one of the very best on the topic of leadership, offering extraordinary stories from leaders at various ages and stages of their lives. Whether you're now in a leadership role and want to further strengthen and hone your skills, or you simply have the desire to learn to make a difference and help guide your company-- or even friends and family members-- to higher levels of success, you'll benefit by reading The Leadership Challenge."<br> -- David S. Pottruck, president &amp; co-CEO, The Charles Schwab Corporation<br> <br> "The first edition was seminal and totally original. It became a modern classic on leadership practically overnight. With this new edition, with new cases and concepts and action steps that are even riper and more important, Kouzes and Posner go way beyond their earlier work and have made yet another brilliant contribution to leadership studies. This new book, a product of an unusual collaboration, is essential reading for everyone involved or concerned with leading."<br> -- Warren Bennis, distinguished professor of business administration, University of Southern California, and author, Geeks and Geezers: Crucibles of Leading and Learning<br> <br> "From the ten commitments of leadership to the emphasis on actions and relationships, this valuable book is full of enduring wisdom and practical insights essential for success in challenging times."<br> -- Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School, best-selling author of Evolve!: Succeeding in the Digital Culture of Tomorrow<br> <br> "For twenty-five years I have written about and taught leadership. The Leadership Challenge is one of the five best books I have ever read. I continually recommend it to others."<br> -- John C. Maxwell, founder, The INJOY Group, and author, The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</p><h2>New College Latin and English Dictionary</h2><p>Second Edition. Completely revised and enlarged.

Drawing on oral histories and period documents and artifacts, C. John Sullivan, a longtime collector of decoys and hunting paraphernalia and a frequent guest curator of exhibits, looks at the effects of technological change, the relationship between hunter and dog, the recognition of decoys as folk art, and the history of hunting. He also introduces us to famous and lesser-known carvers and others who share an enthusiasm for this feature of Chesapeake cultural history and life.</p></p><p><p><b>C. John Sullivan</b> is director of the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and a nationally recognized expert, appraiser, and collector of American waterfowl decoys. He is the author of <i>Decoys: North American Carving Masterpieces Calendar</i> for 2010 and 2011; <i>Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, Decoys &amp; Long Guns: Tales of Carroll&#x2019;s Island Ducking Club</i>; and <i>Old Ocean City</i>, the latter published by the Johns Hopkins University Press. He has contributed to <i>Decoy Magazine</i> and the <i>Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum Quarterly</i> and writes a quarterly column, "Collector&#x2019;s Corner," for the magazine <i>The Canvasback</i>. Decoys in his personal collection have been exhibited at the Havre de Grace Decoy Museum, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, Ward Museum of Wildfowl Art, and Maryland Historical Society. He is a lifelong resident of Fallston in Harford County, Maryland.</p><p>"The antique hunting decoy has become an icon of the Chesapeake Bay. If you have ever admired these old Chesapeake Bay decoys and wondered about the men who made and used them, <i>Waterfowling on the Chesapeake</i> is a must to read. John Sullivan, a lifelong student of Bay decoys and waterfowl hunting history, takes us to the elaborate gunning clubs of the nineteenth-century sportsmen and the less glamorous habitations of the hunters who supplied the Baltimore and Philadelphia markets with choice canvasback ducks. The evolution of waterfowling guns, the use of the deadly sinkbox for hunting offshore, and the origins of the famous retrieving and tolling dogs are woven into the fabric of this comprehensive account. The author shares with us his visits with old-time decoy carvers and waterfowl hunters, bringing to life the rich history of this unique area of Maryland."</p> (Samuel H. Dyke, Ward Museum of Wildfowl Art)<br><br><p>"Since the age of twelve, I have been exposed to shooting on the Chesapeake and its tributary rivers. John Sullivan has created an epic, in depth, study of all phases of this great wildfowling paradise. His readers will be treated to an exceptional visit to this historical sport that has given wholesome employment and tremendous pleasure to thousands."</p> (J. Fife Symington, former chairman, Maryland Historical Society)<br><br><p>"The definitive book on Chesapeake wildfowl hunting has finally been written. John Sullivan has taken his forty plus years of carefully collecting gunning club records, decoy carving biographies, and hunting artifacts and turned it all into the published record and reference we will all use for years to come. Gun laws, duck police, Chesapeake retrievers, guns used, and brands burned into decoys, gun stocks, and the oars used on the sneak boats? It's all here and combined into a logical, readable, and entertaining presentation beyond our expectations."</p> (Henry H. Stansbury, Maryland Historical Society)<br><br><p>"It is hard to imagine the extent of waterfowling in its heyday on the Chesapeake&#x2015;the sheer abundance of migrating birds, the proliferation of gunning clubs and the number of sport and market gunners on these waters, the untold wooden decoys carved and used there. John Sullivan provides insight into this era and shares his deep appreciation for the material culture it has left behind. <i>Waterfowling on the Chesapeake</i> brings previously unexamined aspects of this heritage to light and reassesses some of the region's most prominent decoy carvers."</p> (Pete Lesher, Curator, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum)</p><h2>Introduction Paralegal Studies: Critical Thinking Approach 4 Ed</h2><p>&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Introduction to Paralegal Studies: A Critical Thinking Approach&lt;/b&gt; introduces paralegal students to the law and legal concepts while providing them with practical information about what paralegals actually do in the legal system.

Once at the center of the study of politics, emotions have receded into the shadows during the past three decades, with no place in the rationalistic, structural, and organizational models that dominate academic political analysis.<br> <br> With this new collection of essays, Jeff Goodwin, James M. Jasper, and Francesca Polletta reverse this trend, reincorporating emotions such as anger, indignation, fear, disgust, joy, and love into research on politics and social protest. The tools of cultural analysis are especially useful for probing the role of emotions in politics, the editors and contributors to <i>Passionate Politics</i> argue. Moral outrage, the shame of spoiled collective identities, or the joy of imagining a new and better society, are not automatic responses to events. Rather, they are related to moral institutions, felt obligations and rights, and information about expected effects, all of which are culturally and historically variable.<br> <br> With its look at the history of emotions in social thought, examination of the internal dynamics of protest groups, and exploration of the emotional dynamics that arise from interactions and conflicts among political factions and individuals, <i>Passionate Politics</i> will lead the way toward an overdue reconsideration of the role of emotions in social movements and politics generally.<br> <br> Contributors:<br> Rebecca Anne Allahyari<br> Edwin Amenta<br> Collin Barker<br> Mabel Berezin<br> Craig Calhoun<br> Randall Collins<br> Frank Dobbin<br> Jeff Goodwin<br> Deborah B.

Copyright � 2002. Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. <p>From Chapter 1: What follows is a brief overview of the chapters ahead. </p><p>Chapter 2: The Graphics Rendering Pipeline. This chapter deals with the heart of real-time rendering, the mechanism that takes a scene description and converts it into something we can see. </p><p>Chapter 3: Transforms. Transforms are the basic tools for manipulating the position, orientation, size, and shape of objects and the location and view of the camera. </p><p>Chapter 4: Visual appearance. This chapter covers the definition of materials and lights and their use in achieving a realistic surface appearance. Also covered are other appearance-related topics, such as providing higher image quality through antialiasing and gamma correction. </p><p>Chapter 5: Texturing. One of the most powerful hardware-accelerated tools for real-time rendering is the ability to display data such as images on surfaces. This chapter discusses the mechanics of this technique, called texturing, and presents a wide variety of methods for applying it. </p><p>Chapter 6: Advanced Lighting and Shading. This chapter discusses the theory and practice of correctly represented materials. One focus in on new hardware features such as vertex and pixel shaders. Global illumination algorithms such as ray tracing and radiosity and their relation to real-time rendering is discussed. </p><p>Chapter 7: Non-Photorealistic Rendering. Attempting to make a scene look realistic is only one way of rendering it. This chapter discusses other styles, such as cartoon shading. </p><p>Chapter 8: Image-Based Rendering. Polygons are not always the fastest or most realistic way to describe objects or phenomena such as lens flares or fire. In this chapter, alternate representations based on using images are discussed. </p><p>Chapter 9: Acceleration Algorithms. After you make it go, make it go fast. Various forms of culling and level of detail rendering are covered here. </p><p>Chapter 10: Pipeline Optimization. Once an application is running and uses efficient algorithms, it can be made even faster using various optimization techniques. Finding the bottleneck and deciding what to do about it are the topics covered here. </p><p>Chapter 11: Polygonal Techniques. Geometric data comes from a wide range of sources, and sometimes requires modification in order to be rendered rapidly and well. This chapter discusses polygonal data and ways to clean it up and simplify it. Also included are more compact representations, such as triangle strips, fans, and meshes. </p><p>Chapter 12: Curves and Curved Surfaces. Hardware ultimately deals in points, lines, and polygons for rendering geometry. More complex surfaces offer advantages such as being able to trade off between quality and rendering speed, more compact representation, and smooth surface generation. </p><p>Chapter 13: Intersection Test Methods. Intersection testing is important for rendering, user interaction, and collision detection. In-depth coverage is provided here for a wide range of the most efficient algorithms for common geometric intersection tests. </p><p>Chapter 14: Collision Detection. Finding out whether two objects touch each other is a key element of many real-time applications. This chapter presents some efficient algorithms in the rapidly evolving field. </p><p>Chapter 15: Graphics Hardware. While graphics-hardware-accelerated algorithms have been discussed in the previous chapters, this chapter focuses on components such as color depth, frame buffers, and basic architecture types. Case studies of a few representative graphics accelerators are provided. </p><p>Chapter 16: The Future. Take a guess (we do). </p><p>We have included appendices on linear algebra and trigonometry.</p></p><h2>Great Medieval Projects: You Can Build Yourself</h2><p><p><i>Great Medieval Projects You Can Build Yourself</i> brings the Middle Ages in Europe alive through hands-on activities for kids ages 9-12.

These climatic extremes rule out many standard garden plants that thrive in areas with greater rainfall and more moderate temperatures. Yet there is a wide variety of native plants that are not only beautiful but provide highly satisfactory choices for the western garden. In this comprehensive volume, Robert Nold describes the best picks among perennials and annuals; grasses; bulbs; rock garden plants; cacti; yuccas and other similar plants; shrubs; and trees-more than a thousand plants in all. Leavened with humor and rueful wisdom, Nold's pithy descriptions zero in on each plant's outstanding ornamental characteristics while giving the reader an accurate idea of what to expect from the plant's performance in the garden. With very few exceptions, the recommended plants can be expected to thrive without supplemental irrigation once established, and tolerate winter temperatures as low as -10F (-23C). Throughout, the book is illustrated with vivid color photographs and a selection of exquisite botanical watercolors by artist Cindy Nelson-Nold. Anyone with an interest in hardy, drought-tolerant plants will find in these pages an abundance of tempting possibilities with which to experiment. Indeed, <i>High and Dry</i> can serve as a highly useful tool for resource-conscious gardeners everywhere.</p></p><p>Robert Nold is a regular writer for the rocky Mountain Chapter of the North American Rock Garden Society and the <i>Colorado Gardener</i>. His articles have appeared in <i>The American Gardener</i> and <i>Horticulture</i>, and he was a contributor to the 2004 revision of <i>The American Horticultural Society's A&#x2013;Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants</i>. He is the author of two award-winning Timber Press books: <i>Penstemons</i> and <i>Columbines</i>.Nold aims his expert eye on America&#x2019;s &#x201c;Big Sky&#x201d; high country, providing all who garden in the cold, dry landscape of Rocky Mountain regions with a truly incisive resource for selecting ornamental plants. Summer&#x2019;s extreme heat is considered, along with frigid winters and semiarid conditions, as Nold recommends a wondrous selection of appropriate bulbs and perennials, annuals and grasses, shrubs and cacti. A plant-lover&#x2019;s zeal defines the chapter devoted to species for rock gardens, where Nold puts forward plants that promise to be easily grown, although mostly from seed. The book&#x2019;s trove of plants is brought to life through detailed advice based upon Nold&#x2019;s hard-won understanding of gardening in Denver&#x2019;s unique climatic conditions. Extensive plant profiles offer descriptions of plants, their habits, and cultural requirements. Moreover,&nbsp;entries are filled with Nold&#x2019;s personal experience, helping to govern readers&#x2019; choices as they look to create their own beautiful gardens. --Alice Joyce</p><h2>Henry Plantagenet: A Biography of Henry II of England</h2><p>Henry II is the most imposing figure among the medieval kings of England. His fiefs and domains extended from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, and his court was frequented by the greatest thinkers and men of letters of his time, besides ambassadors from all over Europe. This readable and accessible biography offers both a study of his character, and an estimate of his work as a ruler, work which is in a sense the history of his life, since it occupied his entire energies from his accession at the age of twenty-one to his death thirty-five years later. Nor is this the mere routine of government; from the desolate and lawless anarchy of Stephen&#39;s reign, and against the opposition of the great magnates and the Church, he built in England a stable and prosperous realm, and welded his diverse inheritance overseas into a single, and by the standards of the time, peaceful, unit. Only the folly of John dispersed his empire, and his work in England left an enduring mark on the institutions by which we are governed today.RICHARD BARBER&#39;s other books include Tournaments, with Juliet Barker, Edward Prince of Wales and Aquitaine, The Life and Campaigns of the Black Prince, The Knight and Chivalry and books on King Arthur; he is currently working on a study of the legend of the Holy Grail. 1154-1189</p><p>Richard Barber has published widely on medieval history. The Knight and Chivalry won the 1971 Somerset Maugham Award. His other major interest is historical biography with books on Henry Plantagenet and the Black Prince. His most recent book is Edward III and the Triumph of England: The Battle of Cr�cy and the Order of the Garter.At once objective and readable, it can be thoroughly recommended... An admirable portrait of a great king and his times. CATHOLIC HERALD An able and sympathetic view of Henry, both as man and king. IRISH TIMES</p><h2>The Nature of Birth and Breastfeeding</h2><p><p>A pioneer in the childbirth movement for 30 years, Michel Odent focuses on birth and breastfeeding and suggests some startling conclusions. The Nature of Birth and Breastfeeding has as its premise that in order to gain a truer understanding of the human experience, we must examine the way other mammals function during birth, breastfeeding, and parenting. Odent points out some habitual procedures which becloud the approaches to childbirth in Western society. On the one hand, privacy and minimal intervention are key to the ideal birth environment, yet hospitals and the advent of high-tech obstetrics often dictate the opposite, with a result of higher cesarean and morbidity rates.</p><p></p><p>Odent uncovers another irony--the proven need of mother and infant to receive support for an extensive period of breastfeeding may actually be endangered by the nuclear monogamous family structure. The necessity of allowing women to follow their instincts during labor, birth and breastfeeding is documented by Odent's studies of innate childbirth reactions in various cultures and traditions. The author successfully describes the medical, physiological, social, and emotional rationale behind the need to follow nature's design more closely. Expectant parents, childbirth professionals, psychologists, and all those concerned with our kinship to Mother Earth will find this a provocative and visionary book, which challenges many of our accepted social policies. With <i>The Nature of Birth and Breastfeeding</i> we are closer to the day when, as Dr. Odent puts it the cesarean section will become a rare and wonderful rescue operation, and the now-common terms such as support, assistance, and coaching may find themselves outdated.</p></p><p><p>MICHEL ODENT is Director of Research for the Primal Health Research Center in London. Many of his approaches to childbirth, from anti-intervention to water birth, were formulated during the twenty-three years he was Director of the Maternity Unit in the French State Hospital in Pithiviers. He has published widely in medical journals and is the author of <i>Water and Sexuality</i> (1990), and <i>Birth Reborn</i> (1984), among others.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Hemingway on War</h2><p>Features selections from the author&#39;s first book of short stories, In Our Time, as well as excerpts from A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and The Fifth Column, in a collection of war writings edited by his grandson and featuring a personal foreword by his surviving son. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1899, Ernest Hemingway served in the Red Cross during World War I as an ambulance driver and was severely wounded in Italy. He moved to Paris in 1921, devoted himself to writing fiction, and soon became part of the expatriate community, along with Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, and Ford Madox Ford. He revolutionized American writing with his short, declarative sentences and terse prose. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, and his classic novella <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Known for his larger-than-life personality and his passions for bullfighting, fishing, and big-game hunting, he died in Ketchum, Idaho, on July 2, 1961.<b>Foreword</b> <p>I am sure Ernest Hemingway would be pleased with the selection his grandson Se�n has made from his grandfather's writing on war. Any selection implies just that: some things have been left out, but more than enough has been left in to give the twenty-first-century reader the true gen on war as it was waged in the last hundred years.</p> <p>Hemingway was born in 1899 and had he lived as long as it is possible for a man to live, he could have borne witness to the whole of the deadliest and most war-torn century of which we have a historical record. Sadly, his health began to fail at mid-century and drastically worsened when he was forced to choose by the Cold War between his beloved Finca Vig?a and his country. He died just short of completing the second third of the twentieth century.</p> <p>How much did his going to the wars affect his health and shorten his life? In my opinion, a great deal. As a fortunate American, he chose to go to war rather than, as an unlucky Spaniard or an even unluckier Pole, have it inevitably come to him.</p> <p>James Joyce, perhaps the greatest writer of the twentieth century, neither went to war nor wrote about it in any way but he did not have Hemingway's initially robust constitution and would not have lasted very long in war. Writers who write of war from personal experience have to have special qualities, and I am not sure any of them succeed without strong drink. I like to think that Karl von Clausewitz would never have made it through the Jena campaign without potato schnapps and we know Ulysses S. Grant needed both cigars and corn whiskey to get him through the Wilderness.</p> <p>About the earlier wars: the Italian front in 1918 and the Greco-Turkish War in the 1920s I know only from what my father wrote in such stories as "A Way You'll Never Be," but I do remember when I was ten years old in 1938 and in the fifth grade being beside my father at the top of the stairs on the second floor of our home in Key West when he opened and read a telegram informing him of the start of the last big offensive of the Spanish Republic which would end sixteen weeks later in disaster on the Ebro. Papa left us for Spain at once. That was the year my mother, my younger brother, and I went to war, three whole years before Pearl Harbor. My family was, as they say, prematurely antifascist.</p> <p>Martha Gellhorn, who was a prot�g�e of Mrs. Roosevelt, arranged an invitation for Hemingway to the White House when it was by then very clear that Spain was about to fall to Franco and his German and Italian allies. I remember my father's conversation after that visit, all of us enjoying an excellent meal at the long eighteenth-century Spanish table downstairs in our Key West house in the dining room with the big painting by Joan Mir� of his farm outside Barcelona. Papa was telling us that he had come away from his White House evening with a confirmation of his previous dislike of the President. Things had gotten off to a bad start, from my father's point of view, when the President somewhat gratuitously remarked that he had not read any work of fiction since he was an undergraduate at Harvard. Hemingway must have then recalled to mind what he had written not long before in <i>Green Hills of Africa,</i> that all countries eventually eroded and that the only things that lasted were the people who had practiced the arts. The rest of the evening the President spent telling about, not listening to, what was going on in Spain. Furthermore, said my father, Mrs. Roosevelt, although undoubtedly a person with deep sympathies for humanity in general, was a poor housekeeper and he had never had to eat a worse meal than what was served him at the White House, especially the squab, which was tougher than rubber.</p> <p>Only a year or so later, when the great popular success of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> seemed to confirm the wisdom of his having ended his second marriage, Hemingway left Key West and started a new expatriate life in Cuba with Martha Gellhorn, and they both went as journalists to China and the British and Dutch colonies in the Far East. Marty, long after her marriage to my father had ended, wrote a wonderful memoir of their tour together and Papa at the time produced some of his most prescient military journalism, still very happy to work and live together with Marty as he had done during the Spanish Civil War.</p> <p>Ernest Hemingway loved the sea. He had seafaring ancestors from the age of sail and he and his kid brother, Leicester, once they left Oak Park, the landlocked Chicago suburb where they were born, always made their home within sight of salt water and owned boats, Leicester sail and Ernest power. So when Pearl Harbor brought America into World War II, Papa was uniquely situated to make a highly unconventional contribution to the war effort. From his experience in the Spanish Civil War, he had a wealth of information on the people who now made up the fascist government in that country as well as how they might behave in any Axis intelligence operation against the United States through Latin America, especially Cuba. Despite the snub he had received from President Roosevelt two years before, he contacted Naval Intelligence through the American embassy in Havana, and it accepted his help with intelligence work that led to the arrest of German agents as they tried to disembark in Cuba from Spanish vessels the Falangist political clubs in Spain had helped them travel through Spain to board, vessels which as neutrals could make port in Havana and other destinations in Latin America. Soon afterwards it gave him paramilitary status as captain of his sportfishing boat, <i>Pilar,</i> to play a small part in the large operation to contain and turn back Operation <i>Paukenschlag,</i> the all-out U-boat assault on American coastal shipping lanes in the first six months after America's entry into the war.</p> <p>By the middle of July 1942, the submarine war had mostly shifted to the North Atlantic and Papa felt it was safe enough to bring his two younger sons, Gregory and myself, to spend the rest of our summer vacation with him at Cayo Confites, the tiny offshore island then used by the Cuban military to keep watch on the narrow deepwater channel that separates the northeastern end of Cuba from the southern end of the Bahama Bank. Cayo Confites itself was exactly like that island cartoonists draw with the shipwrecked sailor, but it lacked even a single palm tree, with only the poor unpainted shack that housed the two soldiers who manned a two-way shortwave radio.</p> <p>Greg and I slept in the two forward bunks on the <i>Pilar,</i> which always came in to anchor by the island in the evening after the daytime patrols. During the patrols we were left ashore with our own small skiff, and one day we almost drowned when a summer afternoon line squall caught us goggle fishing a little ways south of the island, swamping our skiff and washing us up on what was, luckily for us, a sandy shore. Goggle fishing was what we called it back then, for the U-boat people had not yet even invented the snorkel, and I think Greg and I were the very first people in the Americas to hunt an underwater coral reef using swimming goggles that had been welded together to give a single plane of vision for both eyes.</p> <p>Marty and Papa's marriage began to fall apart that summer, and on through what passes for fall and winter in the northern tropics, with a great many home truths harshly expressed by both parties. Marty was probably right. With the buildup of shipments of men and materiel from America to Britain in order to launch the second front the Russians so desperately wanted, the U-boat battles now mostly being fought in the approaches to the British Isles, it was time for two veteran war correspondents to gear up and go to cover together the impending invasion of Western Europe. The trouble was Papa was a little more veteran and a lot more writer than Marty, for he was now an old forty-three years, wise to the ways of both art and warfare and with a bad case of piles, a very unpleasant handicap indeed under combat conditions. He was also well aware that Jim Joyce, who had never heard a shot fired in anger, was sitting out the war in Switzerland and was likely to be hailed as the greatest writer of the twentieth century. Later he would joke about such thoughts to his friends in the 4th American Infantry Division, calling himself Ernie Hemorrhoids, the Poor Man's Pyle, but Marty had to use pretty strong words to get him to take up again the war writing burden and he never forgave her.</p> <p>World War II was the last war that Ernest Hemingway covered. When asked by his two youngest boys what he had done in that war, he told us he paid for it. This was a sardonic reference to the confiscatory income tax he paid on the sale of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> to the movies. Just as he had been unfortunate in his prescient but premature antifascism, selling the movie rights to his best-selling novel just at the moment the income tax rates rose to over 80 percent for high income brackets in order to instill a real feeling of sacrifice in the home front people and corporations that stood to profit at last, after twelve dry years, from a war economy, left him dangerously exposed financially. He had turned over the domestic income from his first big success, <i>The Sun Also Rises,</i> to his first wife, Hadley, at the time of their divorce. He was paying a high alimony rate for the support of his second wife, Pauline, and their two young children, and his foreign rights income had been cut off by the war. Most of his profits from <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> had gone to setting up trust funds after his father's suicide for the support of his mother, unmarried sisters, and kid brother, generously added to by G. A. Pfeiffer, Pauline's very rich uncle. His finances had reached their lowest point after the poor sales of <i>Across the River and Into the Trees,</i> when my wife, Henrietta, suggested he and his fourth wife, Mary, could make big money reporting on Mr. Truman's war in Korea. To his credit, he did not throw us out of the Finca Vig?a, where we were visitin...</p></p><h2>Predators</h2><p>Psychologist Anna Salter has been studying sexual offenders and their victims for more than twenty years. What she has learned in countless hours of interviews with sexual predators-from respected community leaders to clergymen and trusted family friends-will shock and outrage readers.What motivates sexual abusers? Why are so few caught? Drawing on the stories of abusers, told in their own words, Salter shows that sexual predators use sophisticated deception techniques and deliberately rely on misconceptions surrounding them to evade discovery. A man who raped more than ninety people tells how he fooled authorities by inserting elements of truth into his story. As recent reports of abuse by priests have shown, abusers often lead double lives in their communities. Two girls repeatedly raped in front of each other told Salter that their assaulter was &#34;still moderator of the town meetings.&#34; Arguing that even the most knowledgeable among us can be fooled, Salter dispels the myths surrounding sexual predators and gives us the tools to protect our families and ourselves.</p><p><b>Anna C. Salter, Ph.D.</b>, lectures and consults throughout the U.S. and abroad, and in 1997 won the Significant Achievement Award from the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers. She is the author of Treating Child Sex Offenders and Victims, Transforming Trauma, and several forensic mysteries. She lives in Madison, Wisconsin.Salter, known for such novels as White Lies, offers a direct and startling look at the alarming problem of sexual predators in the U.S. Drawing on her experience counseling victims and offenders, she creates a daunting picture for the readers. "This is not a book with complete and comfortable answers. It will not finish with a checklist for identifying a sex offender.... But if I do my job right, reading this book will make it harder for sex offenders to get access to you or your children," she says in her introduction. Despite some much publicized media cases, Salter believes there are many misunderstandings about sexual predators. Most of the crimes are premeditated and carefully planned, and fewer than 5% of sexual predators are caught. With anecdotes and case histories, Salter examines such various predators as rapists and child molesters. Then, she goes on to offer some specific strategies to avoid high-risk situations. These tactics consist of monitoring children, even teens, on the Internet; carrying a cell phone; using home security systems, etc. The descriptions of violent attacks and victims' experience will undoubtedly unnerve readers. However, the subject matter is likely to appeal more to police or psychology professionals. The strategies the author offers for readers are usually fairly obvious. While sexual crimes may be on the increase, readers may see this book as necessary only after they've been victimized rather than as a preventive guide. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Big Lebowski and Philosophy: Keeping Your Mind Limber with Abiding Wisdom</h2><p><b>Celebrate the Dude with an abiding look at the philosophy behind <i>The Big Lebowski</i></b> <p>Is the Dude a bowling-loving stoner or a philosophical genius living the good life?

When V<i>estiges of the Natural History of Creation</i> was published anonymously in 1844, it sparked one of the greatest sensations of the Victorian era. More than a hundred thousand readers were spellbound by its startling vision&#x2014;an account of the world that extended from the formation of the solar system to the spiritual destiny of humanity. As gripping as a popular novel, <i>Vestiges</i> combined all the current scientific theories in fields ranging from astronomy and geology to psychology and economics. The book was banned, it was damned, it was hailed as the gospel for a new age. This is where our own public controversies about evolution began.<br><br>In a pioneering cultural history, James A. Secord uses the story of <i>Vestiges</i> to create a panoramic portrait of life in the early industrial era from the perspective of its readers. We join apprentices in a factory town as they debate the consequences of an evolutionary ancestry. We listen as Prince Albert reads aloud to Queen Victoria from a book that preachers denounced as blasphemy vomited from the mouth of Satan. And we watch as Charles Darwin turns its pages in the flea-ridden British Museum library, fearful for the fate of his own unpublished theory of evolution. Using secret letters, Secord reveals how <i>Vestiges</i> was written and how the anonymity of its author was maintained for forty years. He also takes us behind the scenes to a bustling world of publishers, printers, and booksellers to show how the furor over the book reflected the emerging industrial economy of print.<br><br>Beautifully written and based on painstaking research, <i>Victorian Sensation</i> offers a new approach to literary history, the history of reading, and the history of science. Profusely illustrated and full of fascinating stories, it is the most comprehensive account of the making and reception of a book (other than the Bible) ever attempted. <br>&nbsp;Winner of the 2002 Pfizer Award from the History of Science Society</p><p><b>James A. Secord </b>is Reader in the Department of the History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge. He is author of, among others,<i> Controversy in Victorian Geology</i>, editor of the <i>Chicago edition of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation and Other Evolutionary Writings</i>, and coeditor of <i>Cultures of Natural History</i>.Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation was one of the Victorian era's bestsellers. In England in the 1840s, everyone was reading it: aristocrats, students, barmaids, farmers. Those who couldn't read were having it read to them, and everyone was discussing it over tea or ale. Pre-Darwinian, the book shocked and titillated readers by suggesting that the planets and stars had their origin in a blazing fire-mist and that life on earth had evolved. University of Cambridge's Secord traces the history of science in Victorian times and translates the wacky theories in Vestiges into modern, accessible language; he also outlines a history of reading and publishing in 19th-century England. We learn, for example, that in the two decades before the publication of Vestiges, English bookmakers began experimenting with more identifiable bindings. Publishers were wary of new, untested novelists but churned out cheap volumes of nonfiction, many of them on scientific themes. Early in the century, working-class people read primarily religious works, radical political pamphlets and astrology guides, but in the 1830s they began devouring scientific treatises, boning up on phrenology and physiology. Secord also shows how a small army of writers and editors managed to profit from Vestiges--writers were paid top rates to review the book; scientific periodicals began flying off the stands after the book appeared. In addition, a plethora of outraged responses to the perceived sacrilege provide a printed microcosm of the West's longstanding battle between science and religion. Secord's book is an exemplar of nuanced, scholarly curiosity--i.e., he delivers a brief study of the phenomenon of sensation in the 19th century--and clear, understated prose. Anyone interested in English history or the histories of science or literature shouldn't miss it.

This book is an eye-openining and fact-filled exploration of the economic history and marketing logic of packaging, from the sublime to the ridiculous. A penetrating examination of the unexpected meanings hidden in the most familiar boxes, bottles, cans, and tubes. Recommended.Hine's lively and insightful overview of the development of modern packaging, an "important and often unacknowledged" aspect of our lives, touches on a surprising number of subjects, from what and how we eat to the trance induced by a long visit to a supermarket. Hine analyzes all that packaging does, from preserving and protecting the contents to making foodstuffs and products consistent and reliable to providing useful or comforting information. As he tracks the evolution of packaging, Hine draws connections between such corollary developments as transportation, the mass production of paper, and the invention of the flat-bottomed paper bag, folded box, color printing, cellophane, and refrigeration. The establishment of brand recognition is, of course, the whole point of packaging and its offshoot, advertising, and Hine has a field day relating success stories of specific products. His far-reaching discussion embraces everything from the psychology of impulse buying to environmental issues, fast food, and the appeal of certain designs. A captivating and timely work in light of the fact that we've just seen an unprecedented change in package design in the wake of new FDA labeling regulations. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 2 Teacher&#39;s Manual</h2><p>Using the Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 2 Teacher&#x2019;s Manual makes it easy for teachers to help students get the most out of the hands-on, real science experiments presented in the Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 2 Laboratory Notebook. Instructions are provided for guiding students through the experimental process, and guided inquiry questions are suggested to help students think critically about the experiments they are performing. Inexpensive common household items and foods are used for most of the experiments, and a list of materials needed for each experiment is included.

She was then awarded a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of New Mexico, followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism. Instead, they allow students to make up their own minds about what the data show. Real Science-4-Kids, with its engaging, kid-friendly text and easy to use teacher-friendly manuals, is used in home, private, and public schools in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s publishing team continues to develop and test products at her Albuquerque headquarters.

Temperatures were down six degrees; ice sheets kilometres thick buried much of Europe and North America and sea levels were 130m lower. The following 15 millennia saw an astonishing transformation as our planet metamorphosed into the temperate world upon which our civilisation has grown and thrived. One of the most dynamic periods in Earth history saw rocketing temperatures melt the great ice sheets like butter on a hot summer's day; feeding torrents of freshwater into ocean basins that rapidly filled to present levels. The removal of the enormous weight of ice at high latitudes caused the crust to bounce back triggering earthquakes in Europe and North America and provoking an unprecedented volcanic outburst in Iceland. A giant submarine landslide off the coast of Norway sent a tsunami crashing onto the Scottish coast while around the margins of the continents the massive load exerted on the crust by soaring sea levels encouraged a widespread seismic and volcanic rejoinder. <br><br>In many ways, this post-glacial world mirrors that projected to arise as a consequence of unmitigated climate change driven by human activities. Already there are signs that the effects of climbing global temperatures are causing the sleeping giant to stir once again. Could it be that we are on track to bequeath to our children and their children not only a far hotter world, but also a more geologically fractious one?<br></p><p><br>Bill McGuire is an academic, science writer and broadcaster.

No other boatbuilding text has simultaneously served the disparate needs of professional and amateur audiences so successfully. Carl Cramer, the publisher of <i>WoodenBoat</i> and <i>Professional Boatbuilder</i> magazines, has fully updated this fifth edition with the latest in boatbuilding techniques and developments.</p> <p>Includes:</p> <ul><li>The latest wood-epoxy construction methods that make amateur building more successful than ever before </li><li>Recommendations on products and materials, saving you time and money substantial time and expense</li></ul> <p>Topics include: Plans, Tools, Woods, Fiberglass and Other Hull Materials, Fastenings, Lines and Laying Down, Molds, Templates, and the Backbone, Setting Up, Framing, Planking, Deck Framing, Decking, Deck Joinerwork, Interior Joinerwork, Finishing, Sailboat Miscellany, Steering, Tanks, Plumbing, etc, Mechanical and Electrical, Potpourri, Safety </p></p><p><p>The late <b>Robert M.

The chapters on interpreting plans, lofting, and moldmaking are common to all methods. New to this edition are several chapters arising from the "Miscellaneous Details" chapter of earlier editions; an appendix on sharpening tools; expanded tables of metric equivalents; an expanded and annotated source guide for plans, fasteners, hardware, wood, and other staples of boatbuilding; and a list of additional reading. </p><p>Throughout the book, the author recommends products, materials, and services that he has either used or regards highly. This cataloging saves the amateur (and the professional, for that matter) from the considerable time and expense of ferreting out such sources on his own.

Whether caused by something small&#x2014;a broken promise&#x2014;or large&#x2014;a hurricane sweeping across a city&#x2014;disturbance interrupts the status quo. We may find it positive: a promotion, losing weight, a new baby. We may experience it with dread: loss of a job, a contract, a life. No matter what the disruption, because it is disturbing, it can lead to change.<br><br> Disruption, disturbance, tension, upheaval, dissonance, chaos. These conditions stress us. They often challenge our ability to work together toward common goals. Some disruptions, like upheaval and chaos, are more extreme, but they all stimulate change. And though we usually relate to such situations negatively, one key shift to engaging emergence is developing a positive relationship with these sorts of stressors. In fact, disrupting compassionately is a particularly effective approach.<br><br> Most of us avoid tension and disturbances. We attempt to plan them away, control them, or destroy them. Perhaps we hold in our anger because we don&#x2019;t want to cause a fuss. We feel a little more isolated as a result, but order is maintained. We learn to walk around these isolation zones, sometimes forgetting they exist. Yet they typically worsen with time. Alienation, rigidity, greed, intolerance, and inaction or violence grow. Such characteristics are present in many of our current crises.<br><br> What if tensions inspired curiosity? What if we knew how to express our anger, fear, or grief so that it contributed to something better? This introduction describes a fundamental pattern of change as a guide for working with disruption. It examines how disturbances surface useful differences that generate coherent order. It puts emergence in context with other forms of change to clarify when engaging emergence makes sense. It speaks to why engaging emergence matters. The introduction ends by naming benefits of engaging emergence.<br><br> A Pattern of Change<br><br> How does change happen? Whether it is human, cosmological, geological, or biological, some aspects of change are predictable. By understanding them, we are better equipped to work with them. Every system contains the following:<br><br> A DRIVE FOR COHERENCE&#x2014;Relationship, unity, bonding, wholeness, coalescing&#x2014;a coming together&#x2014;convergence. Think of atoms forming molecules, people joining communities, or our longing to contribute to something larger than ourselves.<br><br> OCCASIONAL DISRUPTIONS&#x2014;Interruptions to the status quo, unexpected actions&#x2014;disturbance. Think of natural disasters, angry protesters, changes in work policies or laws.<br><br> A DRIVE FOR DIFFERENTIATION&#x2014;Becoming separate, individual, distinct, unique&#x2014;a breaking apart&#x2014;divergence. Think of teenagers separating from parents to find their identity, a coworker striking off to freelance, or our longing to be accepted for who we are.<br><br> These forces are constantly interacting, mutually influencing each other. Nature plays out this pattern over and over. For example, a new species appears, disrupts the existing ecosystem, sorts out who survives and who goes extinct, and ultimately arrives at a new coherent state. The same dynamics play out in human systems. A case in point: writing this book has been a constant ebb and flow of disruption, differentiation, and coherence.<br><br> Image<br><br> The seeds of this book have been with me for years. The size of the second edition of The Change Handbook disturbed me. We were cataloging methodologies that were being created faster than we could document them. Something deeper was happening. Understanding that something mobilized me to write, hoping to see the different notions that surfaced. Eventually, the outline for the book you now hold coalesced. I was on a roll. I wrote to a schedule because the content was clear. Sometimes, my musings surfaced a useful distinction that found its way into the outline. The work was &#x201c;steady as she goes.&#x201d;<br><br> The first draft was flowing out of me when I tripped. I was starting to write Part 2. I had a headache. I couldn&#x2019;t concentrate. Forcing my way through left me exhausted, the material uninspired. Then it hit me: I faced disruption! I remembered the pattern of change. Treating my frustration with compassion, I acknowledged the disturbance and experimented with differences until something cohered. I realized there was no Part 2. The book got simpler, and I got back to writing.<br><br> The resulting manuscript went to readers. I posted it on a blog. Feedback came from a variety of people, and I looked for distinctions and similarities among their responses. Themes coalesced. I planned my revisions, including adding stories and how-to tips; made an outline; and got to work. And the chapters got longer. Too long. The manuscript asserted itself and I was stuck. Worse, my editor found the organization confusing. This time, I got the message before the headache: welcome disturbance. I experimented with different strategies. What could I delete? Would breaking the material into more chapters eliminate the confusion? Could I use different visual presentations? As options differentiated themselves, I kept tuning in to what the manuscript itself was telling me. I listened for what wanted to emerge. With great editorial coaching, a breakthrough occurred: tell a nonlinear story in a linear way. And so I have.<br><br> Image<br><br> Mostly, the experience was a steady state of writing, reviewing, editing, and writing. Sometimes, distinctions led to incremental shifts&#x2014;adding or removing a chapter. Occasionally, I threw up my hands when the manuscript&#x2019;s organization blew apart. Ultimately, it coalesced into a new, more coherent order. Steady state, incremental shifts, emergence. Understanding these different ways in which change happens equips us to work more effectively with disruption.<br><br> Forms of Change<br><br> Though all change begins with disruption, not all change is emergent. This book focuses on emergent change because it is least understood and we need more effective ways of working with it. Knowing how emergence fits with other forms of change provides perspective on why we are experiencing more and stronger disruptions. It also helps us to understand when engaging emergence makes sense. Emergence will happen whether or not we choose to engage with it. We increase the likelihood of less destructive experiences and more desirable outcomes by working with it. I characterize change in three forms:<br><br> STEADY STATE&#x2014;Disturbance is handled within the existing situation. A minor fix is made, or the disruption is ignored or suppressed. Business as usual continues. For example, a speeder gets a ticket for driving too fast.<br><br> INCREMENTAL SHIFTS&#x2014;Disruptions interrupt the status quo. We distinguish what the disturbance brings to the system and integrate changes. For example, a constitution is amended.<br><br> EMERGENCE&#x2014;Occasional upheaval results when principles that keep a system orderly break down. Chaos sparks experiments. Current assumptions are clarified, and new possibilities surface. Ultimately, something dies and a new coherence arises that contains aspects of the old and the new but isn&#x2019;t either. For example, a revolution leads to a new form of governance.<br><br> Much of today&#x2019;s angst comes from treating all disruptions as if they fit a steady state scenario or, at worst, could be managed through incremental shifts. Economic upheaval, failing schools, increasing terrorism&#x2014;all indicate larger forces in play.<br><br> The Consequences of Not Engaging Emergence<br><br> Most of our current strategies for handling disruptions work well to maintain a stable system or to manage incremental shifts. They are great for moving from where we are to a predetermined outcome. When the root causes of disturbance are more complex, often more emotionally charged, approaching them as if we were fixing a broken car can make the situation worse.<br><br> We maintain our sense of coherence by drawing boundaries, physical or psychological. We protect those inside our neighborhoods or organizations and keep &#x201c;the other&#x201d;&#x2014;people we view as different from us&#x2014;out. Fenced communities and security systems are growing around the world. Airplane travel and immigration are vastly more difficult because of the security we use to keep us safe.<br><br> Such methods are natural responses when our way of life seems threatened. They also isolate us. If someone holds a different view, we better not let him or her in. Bill Bishop&#x2019;s The Big Sort chronicles how people in the United States have sorted themselves into homogeneous communities over the past three decades. We choose neighborhoods, churches, and news shows most compatible with our beliefs.1<br><br> Even if we doubt our &#x201c;tribe&#x2019;s&#x201d; stand on an issue, many of us don&#x2019;t voice it for fear of being ostracized. We hold it in and feel more alone as a result. The outcome: we isolate ourselves based on differences and retreat into a posture of defensive rigidity. In contrast, engaging emergence uses our differences to bring us together, opening us to creative involvement.<br><br> So, increasing numbers of us face complex challenges and don&#x2019;t know how to solve them. Some of us feel stuck or overwhelmed by the accelerating urgency of the conflicts and challenges facing our organizations, communities, families, or even ourselves. Some of us have too many choices and neither the time nor the expertise to discern among them. Others of us see no choices at all. Familiar strategies lead to dead ends, leaving many seeking alternatives. Until we engage emergence, disruptions will continue erupting more and more destructively.<br><br> Consider an industry in upheaval: newspapers. Readership has been falling for decades. Even as newspaper executives acknowledge the radical shifts they need to make, they continue approaching change using the same old strategies. A 2008 article in Editor and Publisher, a time-honored industry journal, makes visible the tragic irony: while we may know we need to change, we don&#x2019;t always know how to do it.<br><br> Image<br><br> &#x201c;Turn and Face the Change&#x2014;With Newspaper Industry in Crisis, &#x2018;Everything&#x2019;s on the Table,&#x2019; &#x201d; exhorted the article.2 It ends, &#x201c;If this is a seminal crisis, then we have to do some seminal thinking. And it really does have to be radical.&#x201d;<br><br> Yet the most innovative idea in the article was distinctly small bore: print less frequently. When the world economy faltered in 2009, the decline turned conundrum into catastrophe. About 15,000 newspaper people lost their jobs.3 More than 100 papers closed their doors, including the 150-year-old Rocky Mountain News.4 The decline was predictable, yet virtually every newspaper is choosing extinction over experimentation. In perhaps the ultimate irony, Editor and Publisher closed its doors in December 2009.<br><br> Image<br><br> Newspaper executives are not alone in struggling with how to approach change. In Change or Die: The Three Keys to Change at Work and in Life, Alan Deutschman quotes experts saying that the root cause of the health crisis hasn&#x2019;t changed for decades.5 Yet the medical establishment can&#x2019;t figure out what to do about it. Individuals also resist change when facing disruption. Deutschman cites research into change-or-die scenarios for patients facing bypass surgery and other diseases that can be mitigated by lifestyle changes. Even when we know we must change, 90 percent of us won&#x2019;t alter our behavior to fit the new situation. We choose death over adaptation.6<br><br> The Other 10 Percent<br><br> In the spirit of turning upheaval into opportunity, what goes on in that 10 percent of cases where we choose adaptation? According to the researchers in Deutschman&#x2019;s book, people find fellowship that inspires, reframe disaster as possibility, and keep practicing. Rather than making incremental shifts, changing a habit here and there, they engage emergence. They redefine the fundamental assumptions that guide their image of themselves and their actions. And they don&#x2019;t do it alone.<br><br> In no particular order, the following table compares traditional thinking about change with ideas that support emergence. This list grew out of my work with emergent change processes. Understanding the differences can help us to make more informed choices about how we approach change.<br><br> Image<br><br> Image<br><br> Changing Notions of Change<br><br> The next time you face disruption and don&#x2019;t know how to approach it, look at the left side of the table. If it reminds you of what you would ordinarily do, look at the right-hand counterpart. Perhaps you will find some new insights for handling your situation. If taking the approach on the right seems like a lot of effort, consider the reasons for doing so.<br><br> Why Does Engaging Emergence Matter?<br><br> Emergence&#x2014;increasingly complex order self-organizing out of disorder&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t just a metaphor for what we are experiencing. Complexity increases as more diversity, connectivity, interdependence, or interactions become part of a system. The disruptive shifts occurring in our current systems are signs that these characteristics are on the rise.<br><br> Today&#x2019;s unprecedented conditions could lead to chaos and collapse, but they also contain the seeds of renewal. We can choose to coalesce into a vibrant, inclusive society through creative interactions among diverse people facing seemingly intractable challenges. In many ways, this path is counterintuitive. It breaks with traditional thinking about change, including the ideas that it occurs top-down and that it follows an orderly plan, one step at a time.<br><br> We don&#x2019;t control emergence. Nor can we fully predict how it arises. It can be violent, overwhelming. Yet we can engage it confident that unexpected and valuable breakthroughs can occur. Working with emergence involves some unfamiliar notions:<br><br> EMBRACING MYSTERY&#x2014;Asking questions in addition to stating answers.<br><br> FOLLOWING LIFE ENERGY&#x2014;Using our intuition in addition to making plans.<br><br> CHOOSING POSSIBILITY&#x2014;Attending to our dreams and aspirations, not just our goals and objectives.<br><br> Change is always happening. When it is emergent change, it seriously disrupts what&#x2019;s familiar. It behooves us to learn how to work with it creatively. Our survival in an increasingly unpredictable world is at stake. When change is treated as an opportunity, prospects for positive outcomes are all around us.<br><br> Emergent change processes have uncovered creative and productive ways to engage emergence. These methods have also surfaced some dependable outcomes from doing so.<br><br> Benefits of Engaging Emergence<br><br> Just because specific outcomes from emergence are unpredictable doesn&#x2019;t make working with emergence impossible. We benefit from engaging emergence in these ways:<br><br> INDIVIDUALLY, WE ARE STRETCHED AND REFRESHED&#x2014;We feel more courageous and inspired to pursue what matters to us. With a myriad of new ideas, and confident of mentors, supporters, and fans, we act.<br><br> At an early Journalism That Matters gathering, a young woman, recently out of college, arrived with the seed of an idea: putting a human face on international reporting for U.S. audiences. At the meeting, she found support for the idea. Deeply experienced people coached her and gave her entr�e to their contacts. Today, the Common Language Project is thriving, with multiple awards (www.clpmag.org).<br><br> NEW AND UNLIKELY PARTNERSHIPS FORM&#x2014;When we connect with people whom we don&#x2019;t normally meet, sparks may fly. Creative conditions make room for our differences, fostering lively and productive interactions.<br><br> A reluctant veteran investigative reporter was tea...</p><h2>Absolutism and Society in Seventeenth-Century France: State Power and Provincial Aristocracy in Languedoc (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern History)</h2><p>Why was Louis XIV successful in pacifying the same aristocrats who had been troublesome for Richelieu and Mazarin? What role did absolutism play in reinforcing or changing the traditional social system in seventeenth-century France? This analysis of the provincial reality of absolutism argues that the answers to these questions lie in the relationship between the regional aristocracy and the crown.

Transcribed from tapes only recently discovered, <i>This Craft of Verse</i> captures the cadences, candor, wit, and remarkable erudition of one of the most extraordinary and enduring literary voices of the twentieth century. In its wide-ranging commentary and exquisite insights, the book stands as a deeply personal yet far-reaching introduction to the pleasures of the word, and as a first-hand testimony to the life of literature.</p><p> Though his avowed topic is poetry, Borges explores subjects ranging from prose forms (especially the novel), literary history, and translation theory to philosophical aspects of literature in particular and communication in general. Probably the best-read citizen of the globe in his day, he draws on a wealth of examples from literature in modern and medieval English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, and Chinese, speaking with characteristic eloquence on Plato, the Norse kenningar, Byron, Poe, Chesterton, Joyce, and Frost, as well as on translations of Homer, the Bible, and the Rub�iy�t of Omar Khayy�m.</p><p>Whether discussing metaphor, epic poetry, the origins of verse, poetic meaning, or his own "poetic creed," Borges gives a performance as entertaining as it is intellectually engaging. A lesson in the love of literature and in the making of a unique literary sensibility, this is a sustained encounter with one of the writers by whom the twentieth century will be long remembered.</p></p><p>Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) was the author of <i>Labyrinths</i> and <i>Ficciones</i>, among other books.Borges started to make a living by lecturing after overcoming the shyness that made him stutter, marring his early years. Although he never lost entirely the fear of large audiences, he managed to make a master form out of the public lecture genre. Some of his best essays were first delivered as talks, mostly in the English tradition of confession, wit, and eloquence. This performance of intelligent intimacy with the audience gave his rich commentary and bright summation a conversational tone and the poignancy of a revelation. Borges had an epiphanic view of reading, and to him literature was a memory of the exceptional. These lectures have that elegance and edge, indeed the beauty of the best possible library on the happiest of islands. (Julio Ortega, Brown University)<br><br>In <i>fThis Craft of Verse</i>, [Borges] discusses some of his favorite texts, conducting a literary journey that began in his father's library in Buenos Aires...The unhurried flow and warmth of these talks produce a sense of intimacy, Borges's enjoyment infecting the audience...Borges's ultimate gift is his unwavering belief in the world of dreams and ideas, the sense that life is "made of poetry." (Micaela Kramer <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Jorge Luis Borges is inarguably the most influential Latin-American essayist and short-story writer of our time. To spend a few hours in [his] company, even on the page, is a civilized entertainment not to be missed...[Borges] emphasizes the power of poetry to work its magic...I would have given a lot to have been at Harvard in the audience when this courtly man of letters looked "upward with gentle and shy expression on his face, seeming to materially touch the world of the texts" and spoke about the poems and books he loved most. (Michael Dirda <i>Washington Post Book World</i>)<br><br>If few writers in history have been as prodigiously learned as Borges, certainly none wore their learning so lightly or humbly...[The lectures] display the eloquence and erudite, offhand wit familiar from his writings as well as a charming, plainspoken modesty. Ostensibly about poetics, the talks were an occasion for Borges to review his lifelong relationship with literature, including his passion for English. (<i>New Yorker</i> 2000-11-06)<br><br>Readers who fret they don't 'get' everything--'significant' readers with no allowance for sound, rhythm, revelation--would benefit from Jorge Luis Borges' [lectures]...Even in these scholarly lectures, given without notes...there is so much assumption and conjecture, there are so many gaps to fill, that Borges seems to be creating at once the authors and the ideas and the texts he's quoting...But there is also in <i>This Craft of Verse</i> the small pleasure of watching a wordsmith seek the joy of minutiae, the nitty-gritty of lex. (Orlando Aloma <i>Miami Herald</i> 2000-10-15)<br><br>These newly released transcripts display a literary giant, managing from beneath heavy academic robes to keep the spryness and serendipity of literature alive...Here Borges daydreams aloud, and the result is wonderfully disarming. (Carlin Romano <i>Boston Globe</i> 2000-11-06)<br><br>What's most astonishing about these previously uncollected essays...is that for all their complexity and elusiveness they are oral performances. While Borges's blindness is a major figure in his writing, the breadth and density of his rhetorical web obscures the fact that he has no notes to read, that he is calling these texts up from the inexhaustible abyss of his memory...In his decomposition of genres and styles, Borges provokes language to express this immanent word-magic, knitting his own pronouncements together with the primordial force of oral composition. Borges speaks on metaphor, bringing the tangled, sensuous allegories of San Juan de la Cruz into contact and concert with the cold, salty kennings of the Norse Eddas. He discusses translation with freshness and an uncanny sensitivity to the ligatures among the languages; he considers the narrative arc and the transformation of thought into poetry...As editor Calin-Andrei Mihailescu puts it in his graceful afterword to this volume, 'Literature,' for Borges, 'was a mode of experience.' (Matthew Battles <i>www.hermenaut.com</i>)<br><br>Few have dedicated themselves to literature with the purity of Jorge Luis Borges, so the discovery of the text of his Harvard University Norton Lectures for 1967-68, now published as <i>This Craft of Verse</i>, is cause for celebration. Common sense and radical insight flow in equal measure here: <i>This Craft of Verse</i> will inspire young and old alike to follow the muses. And now, more than 30 years later, one can actually listen to the lectures: in a 4-CD set, the words of the master come thrillingly alive in his own voice. (Tom D'Evelyn <i>Providence Sunday Journal</i> 2000-12-24)<br><br>If any writer could publish from the grave, you'd expect it to be Borges: master fabulist, patron of paradox, imaginative rebel, gentle tour guide to life's labyrinths. By a kind of librarian's magic, long-lost tapes of the great Argentine poet and short-story writer's 1967-68 Norton Lectures at Harvard turned up a few years ago in a vault. Now...these newly released transcripts display a literary giant, managing from beneath heavy academic robes to keep the spryness and serendipity of literature alive...An appealing aspect of these meditations is Borges' humility, always distinctive even after he became one of the world's most esteemed high-cultural figures...His views will delight. (Carlin Romano <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> 2000-10-29)<br><br>Anything written by Borges glows...with an unearthly light that transforms the world into a plushly furnished drawing room crammed with knicknacks and dusty, leather-bound volumes of arcana...Almost every casual aside from Borges suggests a book of its own; this one is a wondrously limpid testament to the pleasures of reading.

Equally ubiquitous, though until now less the subject of serious inquiry, are temporary memorials: spontaneous offerings of flowers and candles that materialize at sites of tragic and traumatic death. In <i>Memorial Mania,</i> Erika Doss argues that these memorials underscore our obsession with issues of memory and history, and the urgent desire to express&#x2014;and claim&#x2014;those issues in visibly public contexts. </p><p>Doss shows how this desire to memorialize the past disposes itself to individual anniversaries and personal grievances, to stories of tragedy and trauma, and to the social and political agendas of diverse numbers of Americans. By offering a framework for understanding these sites, Doss engages the larger issues behind our culture of commemoration. Driven by heated struggles over identity and the politics of representation, <i>Memorial Mania </i>is a testament to the fevered pitch of public feelings in America today.</p></p><p><p><b>Erika Doss</b> is professor of American studies at the University of Notre Dame and the author of <i>Benton</i><i>, Pollock, and the Politics of Modernism: From Regionalism to Abstract Expressionism</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press, among other titles.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Memorial Mania</i> is an important and much-needed book, one that complements the existing literature on memorials with richness and originality, and also forges new territory.

This memoir, vividly internal, powerfully lyric, and brilliantly impressionistic, is his story.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the first four years of his life, Prahlad didn&#x2019;t speak. But his silence didn&#x2019;t stop him from communicating&#x2014;or communing&#x2014;with the strange, numinous world he found around him. Ordinary household objects came to life; the spirits of long-dead slave children were his best friends. In his magical interior world, sensory experiences blurred, time disappeared, and memory was fluid. Ever so slowly, he emerged, learning to talk and evolving into an artist and educator. His journey takes readers across the United States during one of its most turbulent moments, and Prahlad experiences it all, from the heights of the Civil Rights Movement to West Coast hippie enclaves to a college town that continues to struggle with racism and its border state legacy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rooted in black folklore and cultural ambience, and offering new perspectives on autism and more, <i>The Secret Life of a Black Aspie</i> will inspire and delight readers and deepen our understanding of the marginal spaces of human existence.</p><p><b>Anand Prahlad </b>is director of the Creative Writing Program at the University of Missouri, Columbia, and the author of two books of poems, <i>Hear My Song and Other Poems </i>and <i>As Good as Mango</i>.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Readers won&#x2019;t easily forget this prismatic and powerful story of an atypical life.&#x201d; (Starred review <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Read it and weep tears of inferiority, knowing you will never write anything as beautiful and transcendent.&#x201d; (Harvard Bookstore)<br><br>&#x201c;At once lovely, disorienting and musical . . . a truly revelatory encounter.&#x201d; (<i>Columbia Daily Tribune</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Prahlad&#x2019;s world, is a beautiful one, full of connection that defy all physical logic and a unique view on time, space, and personal identity that rivals the very best of genre fiction.&#x201d; (<i>Daily News-Miner</i>)</p><h2>Principles of Pragmatics (Longman Linguistics Library)</h2><p>Over the years, pragmatics - the study of the use and meaning of utterances to their situations - has become a more and more important branch of linguistics, as the inadequacies of a purely formalist, abstract approach to the study of language have become more evident. This book presents a rhetorical model of pragmatics: that is, a model which studies linguistic communication in terms of communicative goals and principles of 'good communicative behaviour'.<br><br>In this respect, Geoffrey Leech argues for a rapprochement between linguistics and the traditional discipline of rhetoric. He does not reject the Chomskvan revolution of linguistics, but rather maintains that the language system in the abstract - i.e. the 'grammar' broadly in Chomsky's sense - must be studied in relation to a fully developed theory of language use. There is therefore a division of labour between grammar and rhetoric, or (in the study of meaning) between semantics and pragmatics.<br><br>The book's main focus is thus on the development of a model of pragmatics within an overall functional model of language. In this it builds on the speech avct theory of Austin and Searle, and the theory of conversational implicature of Grice, but at the same time enlarges pragmatics to include politeness, irony, phatic communion, and other social principles of linguistic behaviour.<br><br></p><p>Geoffrey Leech was Professor of Linguistics and Modern English Language at Lancaster University from 1974 to 1996. He then became Research Professor in English Linguistics.

A lonely child, he found solace in Old Joe's simple wisdom and folk charms. The magic was lost, however, when Joe disappeared without warning one fall.</p><p>Years later, Jay's life is stalled with regret and ennui. His bestselling novel, <i>Jackapple Joe,</i> was published ten years earlier and he has written nothing since. Impulsively, he decides to leave his urban life in London and, sight unseen, purchases a farmhouse in the remote French village of Lansquenet. There, in that strange and yet strangely familiar place, Jay hopes to re-create the magic of those golden childhood summers. And while the spirit of Joe is calling to him, it is actually a similarly haunted, reclusive woman who will ultimately help Jay find himself again.</p></p><p>Joanne Harris's first novel, <i>Chocolat</i>, was set in the sleepy French village of Lansquenet, where enchantment, romance, and soft-centered truths issued from the local confectioner's shop. She returns to the same location for <i>Blackberry Wine</i>. But as the title suggests, she's shifted her focus from food to drink, choosing a half-dozen bottles of homemade plonk as the catalyst for her "layman's alchemy." And even the narrator is no human being but a faintly tannic Fleurie 1962: "A pert, garrulous wine, cheery and little brash, with a pungent taste of blackcurrant!"<p> There are, of course, some less vinous characters in the novel. Harris's protagonist, Jay Mackintosh, is a former literary star, now sadly stalled. He spends his time writing second-rate science fiction, leading a hollow media life, and drinking: "Not to forget, but to remember, to open up the past and find himself there again." Yet the nice, expensive wines don't do the trick. Instead, six "Specials"--a gift from his old friend Joe--function as Jay's magical elixir. Like Proust's lime-blossom tisane, they give him the gift of his memories but also unlock his future, which encourages him to flee the rut of his London life and buy a house in Lansquenet. </p><p> As Jay settles in, he contemplates his childhood friendship with Joe, whose idiosyncratic outlook was the inspiration for his only successful book. Meanwhile, he becomes involved in village life, encountering some familiar faces from <i>Chocolat</i>. Caro and Toinette, the snooty troublemakers, soon put in an appearance, and Josephine, the bar owner and battered wife of the earlier novel, becomes a real friend. But it's a new character, the enigmatic Marise, who becomes the focus of Jay's attention--and who helps to restore his literary joie de vivre. This feat of resurrection makes for a hugely enjoyable read. It also goes one step further in adding Lansquenet to the map of imaginary destinations, where daydreams can come true with intoxicating frequency. <i>--Eithne Farry</i></p>From the author of <i>Chocolat</i>, an intoxicating fairy tale of alchemy and love where wine is the magic elixir. <br> <br>Jay Mackintosh is a 37-year-old has-been writer from London. Fourteen years have passed since his first novel, Jackapple Joe, won the Prix Goncourt. His only happiness comes from dreaming about the golden summers of his boyhood that he spent in the company of an eccentric vintner who was the inspiration of Jay's debut novel, but who one day mysteriously vanished. Under the strange effects of a bottle of Joe's '75 Special, Jay decides to purchase a derelict yet promising ch�teau in Lansquenet-sous-Tannes. There, a ghost from his past waits to confront him, and his new neighbour, the reclusive Marise - haunted, lovely and dangerous - hides a terrible secret behind her closed shutters. Between them, there seems to be a mysterious chemistry. Or could it be magic? <br> <br>Joanne Harris's last novel, <i>Chocolat</i>, was both a dazzling literary success and a commercial triumph. <i>Chocolat</i>, the major motion picture directed by Lasse Hallstr�m ( <i>The Cider House Rules</i>), is scheduled for release in December 2000 and stars Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Dame Judy Dench, Alfred Molina, and Lena Olin.</p><h2>Meet Me at Jim &amp; Andy's: Jazz Musicians and Their World</h2><p>Gene Lees, author of the highly acclaimed <em>Singers and the Song</em>, offers, in <em>Meet Me at Jim and Andy's</em>, another tightly integrated collection of essays about post-War American music. This time he focuses on major jazz instrumentalists and bandleaders.<br> Jim and Andy's, on 48th Street just west of Sixth Avenue, was one of four New York musicians' haunts in the 1960s--the others being Joe Harbor's Spotlight, Charlie's, and Junior's. "For almost every musician I knew," Lees writes, "[it was] a home-away-from-home, restaurant, watering hole, telephone answering service, informal savings (and loan) bank, and storage place for musical instruments."<br> In a vivid series of portraits, we meet its clientele, an unforgettable gallery of individualists who happen to have been major artists--among them Duke Ellington, Artie Shaw, Woody Herman, Art Farmer, Billy Taylor, Gerry Mulligan, and Paul Desmond. We share their laughter and meet their friends, such as the late actress Judy Holliday, their wives, even their children (as in the tragic story of Frank Rosolino). We learn about their loves, loyalties, infidelities, and struggles with fame and, sometimes alcohol and drug addiction. The magnificent pianist Bill Evans, describing to Lees his heroin addiction, says, "It's like death and transfiguration. Every day you wake in pain like death, and then you go out and score, and that is transfiguration. Each day becomes all of life in microcosm."<br> Himself a noted songwriter, Lees writes about these musicians with vividness and intimacy. Far from being the inarticulate jazz musicians of legend, they turn out to be eloquent indeed, and the inventors of a colorful slang that has passed into the American language.<br> And of course there was the music. A perceptive critic with enormous respect for the music he writes about, Lees notes the importance and special appeal of each artist's work, as in this comment about Artie Shaw's clarinet: "A fish, it has been said, is unaware of water, and Shaw's music so permeated the very air that it was only too easy to overlook just how good a player and how inventive and significant an improviser he was."<br></p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> Gene Lees, author of <em>Singers and the Song</em> and editor and publisher of the respected <em>Jazzletter</em>, has written extensively for publications such as <em>Down Beat</em> and <em>Stereo Review</em>, of which he is a former editor. He is also a lyricist whose songs include <em>Quiet Nights on Quiet Stars</em> and <em>Someone to Light</em> <em>Up My Life</em>, and <em>Yesterday I Heard the Rain</em>.<br>"This is one of the best books ever written on jazz musicians. I hope you keep it in print forever."--Brian Torff, Fairfield Univ.<br><br>"...story is told by Gene Lees in a relaxed and friendly way...but in a way the musicians write the book as they recall engaging stories of how it was.

In so doing, he has contributed another essential volume to the slender shelf of first-rate writing about jazz."--Commentary<br><br>"What makes Lees' observations on the music so fascinating is his ability to use his musical knowledge (as a singer and songwriter) in a way which helps illuminate the music he is talking about....[This book] leaves the reader with a warm feeling for the musicians and their contributions to the art."--Coda<br><br>"Filled with perceptive observations and richly entertaining tales of the jazz scene....Wit and insight abound in this very readable book."--The Washington Times</p><h2>All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas</h2><p>Updated and revised to include theoretical and other developments, bibliographical additions, new photographs and illustrations, and expanded name and subject indexes, the fourth edition of <em>All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas</em> is the most complete and comprehensive book of its kind.

It has been published in four languages other then English and has been the most comprehensive work on the subject since its inception in 1972 when I first used it as the text in my 'Nature of Geography' course. This is essential reading for all geographers."--Peter Nash, <em>University of Waterloo, Canada</em><p></p><br>"After thirty-odd years, <em>All Possible Worlds</em> remains without peer: a uniquely valuable treasure for anyone curious about the evolution of geographic thought and achievement throughout the world from ancient times to a troubled present. Perhaps what is most remarkable about this chronicle is the judicious manner with which the author deals with endlessly contentious philosophies and methodologies. We have here an essential item for the library of every serious geographer."--Wilbur Zelinsky, <em>The Pennsylvania State University</em><p></p><br>"This is the only book in the English language (and perhaps any language) to reveal much of the history of geography from Greco-Roman to modern times. It includes chapters on classical geography, the Middle Ages, the Age of Exploration, the impact of discoveries, and a summary of mid-19th century thought. The history of geography in the US is juxtaposed with the emerging geographies of Germany, France, Great Britain, Russia/USSR, Canada, Sweden, and Japan from the time of Darwin's elaboration of his evolutionary hypothesis. . . .indispensable reading for geographers and other social scientists. <strong>Summing Up: Highly Recommended.</strong>"--M.W.

Reissue.</p><p>"The time will come when she will be ranked above Hemingway." --Leon Edel <p>In this powerful portrait of the self-making of an artist, Willa Cather created one of her most extraordinary heroines. Thea Kronborg, a minister's daughter in a provincial Colorado town, seems destined from childhood for a place in the wider world. But as her path to the world stage leads her ever farther from the humble town she can't forget and from the man she can't afford to love, Thea learns that her exceptional musical talent and fierce ambition are not enough. <br>It is in the solitude of a tiny rock chamber high in the side of an Arizona cliff--"a cleft in the heart of the world"--that Thea comes face to face with her own dreams and desires, stripped clean by the haunting purity of the ruined cliff dwellings and inspired by the whisperings of their ancient dust. Here she finds the courage to seize her future and to use her gifts to catch "the shining, elusive element that is life itself--life hurrying past us and running away, too strong to stop, too sweet to lose." In prose as shimmering and piercingly true as the light in a desert canyon, Cather takes us into the heart of a woman coming to know her deepest self.</p>Born in Virginia in 1873 and raised on a Nebraska ranch, Willa Cather is known for her beautifully evocative short stories and novels about the American West. Cather became the managing editor for <b>McClure&#x2019;s Magazine</b> in 1906 and lived for forty years in New York City with her companion Edith Lewis. In 1922 Cather won the Pulitzer Prize for <b>One of Ours</b>, the story of a Western boy in World War I. In 1933 she was awarded the Prix Femina Americaine &#x201c;for distinguished literary accomplishments.&#x201d; She died in 1947. <p> Photo: AKG London </p></p><h2>English the American Way: A Fun ESL Guide to Language &amp; Culture in the U.S. w/Audio CD &amp; MP3 (English as a Second Language Series)</h2><p><b>REA's <i>English the American Way: A Fun ESL Guide to Language &amp; Culture in the U.S. with Audio CD + MP3</i></b><i><br><br></i><b>A fun guide to everything American for the English language learner!</b><br><br>The warm and witty authors of <i>Celebrate the American Way: A Fun ESL Guide to Language and Culture in the U.S.</i> get you started on your ESL journey with <i>English the American Way: A Fun ESL Guide to Language &amp; Culture in the U.S.</i><br><br><i>English the American Way</i> is your companion to everyday life in the United States.

A seemingly unlikely chronicler, Wharton, more usually associated with American high society, explored the country for a month by military vehicle. Travelling from Rabat and Fez to Moulay Idriss and Marrakech, she recorded her encounters with Morocco's people, traditions and ceremonies, capturing a country at a moment of transition from an almost unknown, road less empire to a popular tourist destination. Her descriptions of the places she visited - mosques, palaces, ruins, markets and harems - are typically observant and brim with color and spirit, whilst her sketches of the country's history and art are rigorous but accessible.This is a wonderful account by one of the most celebrated novelists and travel writers of the 20th century and is a fascinating portrayal of an extraordinary country.

She was born in 1862 and died in 1937. Wharton was the first woman ever to win the Pulitzer Prize, for The Age of Innocence. She traveled widely in Morocco during the Great War.</p>Armchair travelers and history buffs will delight in this recording. Wharton&#39;s language alternates between unimpassioned frankness and voluptuous description of Morocco&#39;s staggering natural and cultural beauty. Anna Fields takes her cue from the text, delivering a clipped and assured reading when Wharton discusses conveyance, history and other mundane matters, and an unhurried, even dreamy, reading of Wharton&#39;s sensuous and evocative descriptions. Those who have visited or lived in Morocco will feel immediately transported to familiar sites during these descriptive passages. The listening experience is made the more interesting because Wharton&#39;s account was written during one month of travel in the final year of WW I and first published eight decades ago. More recent travelers, who will discover much that is familiar here, are likely to enjoy the description more than the recitation of history. T.B.

The idea seems to contradict the values of the Republic and its Founding Fathers. But in <i>Empire of Debt</i>, prominent financial analysts Bill Bonner and Addison Wiggin argue passionately that not only is the United States an empire, but it is also one whose end is coming soon. Bonner and Wiggin are the brains behind www.dailyreckoning.com, an iconoclastic and irreverent market advisory service that has long raised concerns about American indebtedness and warned of a looming dollar crisis. In <i>Empire of Debt</i>, a sequel to their earlier doom-and-gloom book <i>Financial Reckoning Day</i>, they elaborate on their argument that the U.S. economy is about to implode. <p> Bonner and Wiggin enumerate a long list of chronic ailments that imperil the American financial system--a massive trade deficit, soaring personal and government debt, a housing bubble, runaway military expenditures. These problems "hardly disturb the sleep of the imperial race," the authors write. "[But] all empires must pass away." Bonner and Wiggin argue that American imperial delusions are similar to the fantasies that fueled the dot-com market mania. They recommend readers buy gold as insurance in the event of a financial crisis. <i>Empire of Debt</i> flounders when discussing how America indebted itself; the authors blame the Federal Reserve Board's low interest rates but gloss over the fact that rates were slashed because the U.S. teetered on the brink of deflation in 2002 and 2003 (a topic they give more attention to in <i>Financial Reckoning Day</i>). As hardcore free-marketeers, Bonner and Wiggin also seem to long for the pre-welfare days of the 1920s but forget how that period's policies led to the Great Depression. That said, <i>Empire of Debt</i> contains many revelations that will open eyes. <i>--Alex Roslin</i></p>There was a time when being a "conservative" meant you were a stodgy old curmudgeon; an isolationist, closed to new ideas. Now, the conservatives are leading the charge&#x2014;promising to make the entire world "safe for democracy!" Never has such a bold plan been put into action&#x2014;that is, not since the "liberal" democrat Woodrow Wilson coined the phrase nearly a century ago! <p>How could such a shift in the politics and economy of the United States have come about in a span of less than 100 years?</p> <p>In <i>Empire of Debt</i>, maverick financial writers Bill Bonner and Addison Wiggin&#x2014;the team that brought you the international bestseller <i>Financial Reckoning Day</i>&#x2014;reunite to provide you with the first in-depth look at how the American character has shifted to accommodate its new imperial role; how we have abandoned the private virtues of personal liberty, economic freedom, and fiscal restraint; and how the "guv'mint" has gained control of public life and the economy. The result has been, among other horrors, unfettered deficit spending, gluttonous consumption, and fearless military adventurism. All the while, the nation slouches ever more precipitously towards bankruptcy.</p> <p><i>Empire of Debt</i> is a wry, witty, and erudite look at the state of the empire. To the delight of many, Bonner and Wiggin do not spare the political icons of either national political party. Casting a wide-angle lens through history and into the next century, the authors suggest a "great empire" is to the world of geopolitics what a great bubble is to the world of economics&#x2014;it is attractive at first but will eventually end in catastrophe.</p> <p>Unfortunately for some, the <i>Empire of Debt</i> will be received like an unwelcome guest who intends to spend the night. But for those who open the door to the often uproarious, but always sensible, wisdom within these pages, the future will be bright, indeed.</p> <p>"They've done it again!" says financial commentator Eric Fry, "Once more, Bonner and Wiggin have weaved together the disparate worlds of politics, economics, and personal finance to produce an enormously entertaining snapshot of modern American life." We entreat you to sit back, relax, and drink in the splendor that is America's Empire of Debt.</p></p><h2>Structural Renovation of Buildings: Methods, Details, &amp; Design Examples</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p>Alexander Newman, P.E., is principal structural engineer with Maguire Group, Inc., a national architectural, engineering and planning firm, in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

However during 17th century England it was illegal to preach outside the auspices of the Church of England. His failure to obey this law would land him in the Bedfordshire county jail twice, first for a period of twelve years, and then later for a period of six months. Bunyan could have avoided this harsh sentence if he had simply promised not to continue his preaching, however his faith would not allow him to do so. It was during this incarceration that he would begin composition of &#x201c;The Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress,&#x201d; a work that has come to be regarded as one of the most important works of religious English literature. First published in 1678, &#x201c;The Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress&#x201d; is a Christian allegory in the same vein of many such works of Bunyan&#x2019;s time. It concerns the travel of an everyman named Christian who travels from his home, &#x201c;The City of Destruction&#x201d;, to &#x201c;The Celestial City&#x201d; atop Mount Zion. &#x201c;The City of Destruction&#x201d; is a parallel for this world and &#x201c;The Celestial City&#x201d; for the next. In this characterization the journey of Christian can be seen as the quest of man to escape the burden of Earthly sin and find salvation for his soul in heaven. This edition contains both the first and second part of &#x201c;The Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress,&#x201d; includes an introduction by Charles S. Baldwin, and is printed on premium acid-free paper.</p><p>Bunyan&#39;s allegory is still as fresh today as when it was written in the late 1600s. Includes helpful textual notes and Bible references in the page margins.John Bunyan was born in Elstow, Bedfordshire, England, in 1628. He learned to read and write at the village school and was prepared to follow his father&#39;s trade as a brazier when the English Civil War broke out in 1644 and he was drafted into the Parliamentary army. His military service brought him into contact with Oliver Cromwell&#39;s Puritan troops. Beginning in 1648, Bunyan suffered a crisis in religious faith that lasted for several years. He turned to the Nonconformist church in Bedford to sustain him during this period. His first writings were attacks against the Quakers. Then Charles II was restored to the throne and Bunyan was arrested for conducting services not in accordance with the Church of England. He spent 12 years in jail. During this time, he wrote his autobiography, Grace Abounding, in which he described his spiritual struggle and growth. During his last years in prison, Bunyan began his most famous work, The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress, a two-part allegorical tale of the character Christian and his journey to salvation. Part I was published in 1678 and Part II in 1684. The second part deals with the spiritual journey of Christian&#39;s wife and sons, as they follow in his footsteps. With its elements of the folktale tradition, The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress became popular immediately. Well into the nineteenth century it was a book known to almost every reader in England and New England, second in importance only to the Bible. So great was the book&#39;s influence that it even plays a major role in Little Woman by Louisa May Alcott. Such expressions as &#34;the slough of despond&#34; and &#34;vanity fair&#34; have become part of the English language. Bunyan&#39;s other works include The Life and Death of Mr. Badman and The Holy War. He also wrote A Book for Boys and Girls, verses on religious faith for children. Bunyan died in London on August 31, 1688.</p><h2>Fugitive Landscapes: The Forgotten History of the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands (The Lamar Series in Western History)</h2><p><b>Published in Cooperation with the William P. Clements Center for Southwest Studies</b>In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Mexicans and Americans joined together to transform the U.S.&#x2013;Mexico borderlands into a crossroads of modern economic development. This book reveals the forgotten story of their ambitious dreams and their ultimate failure to control this fugitive terrain.<br>Focusing on a mining region that spilled across the Arizona&#x2013;Sonora border, this book shows how entrepreneurs, corporations, and statesmen tried to domesticate nature and society within a transnational context. Efforts to tame a &#x201c;wild&#x201d; frontier were stymied by labor struggles, social conflict, and revolution. <i>Fugitive Landscapes</i> explores the making and unmaking of the U.S.&#x2013;Mexico border, telling how ordinary people resisted the domination of empires, nations, and corporations to shape transnational history on their own terms.&nbsp; By moving beyond traditional national narratives, it offers new lessons for our own border-crossing age.<br><br></p><p><b>Samuel Truett</b> is associate professor, Department of History, University of New Mexico. <br>"Samuel Truett not only recovers&nbsp;the hidden history of the Arizona-Sonora borderlands and their often-shadowy residents but also reinterprets familiar events in a new light.

Greene, immigrant statesman cum military commander Emilio Kosterlitzky are just three colorful figures from this binational history&#x2019;s near-forgotten central casting), and state agencies, Truett demonstrates convincingly how Mexican and U.S. histories intersect and intermingle just as the space they share clash and merge.&nbsp; This intriguing study also suggests how differently national histories would look and feel when re-centered and viewed from a transnational vantage point.&#x201d; &#x2014;Evelyn Hu-DeHart, Brown University<br> (Evelyn Hu-DeHart)<br><br>"Truett has written one of the most compelling borderlands narratives to date.&nbsp;. . .

The objectives of the text are to introduce students to the standard concepts and methods of stochastic modeling, to illustrate the rich diversity of applications of stochastic processes in the applied sciences, and to provide exercises in the application of simple stochastic analysis to realistic problems.</p> <b>About This Edition</b><br> <p>In the fourth edition, we have added two new chapters: Chapter 10 on random evolution and Chapter 11 on characteristic functions. Chapter 10, "Random Evolution," denotes a set of stochastic models, which describe continuous motion with piecewise linear sample functions. Explicit formulas are available in the simplest cases. In the general case, one has a central limit theorem, which is pursued more generally in Chapter 11, &#x201c;Characteristic Functions and Their Applications.&#x201d; Here the necessary tools from Fourier analysis are developed and applied when necessary. Many theorems are proved in full detail, while other proofs are sketched--in the spirit of the earlier Chapters 1-9. Complete proofs may be found by consulting the intermediate textbooks listed in the section on further reading. Instructors who have taught from the third edition may be reassured that Chapters 1-9 of the new edition are identical to the corresponding chapters of the new book.</p> <b>Changes This Edition</b><br> <ul> <li>Realistic applications from a variety of disciplines integrated throughout the text, including more biological applications</li> <li>Plentiful, completely updated problems</li> <li>Completely updated and reorganized end-of-chapter exercise sets, 250 exercises with answers</li> <li>New chapters of stochastic differential equations and Brownian motion and related processes</li> <li>Additional sections on Martingale and Poisson process</li> </ul> <p>Read a sample chapter from <i>Introduction to Stochastic Modeling</i>. </p><p>PRAISE FOR THE SECOND EDITION "This book is a valuable resource for anyone studying combustion processes." --<b>David L.

More than a detailed history of a museum and tourist attraction, it examines the packaging of American history, and consumerism and the manufacturing of cultural beliefs. Through extensive fieldwork&#x2014;including numerous site visits, interviews with employees and visitors, and archival research&#x2014;Richard Handler and Eric Gable illustrate how corporate sensibility blends with pedagogical principle in Colonial Williamsburg to blur the lines between education and entertainment, patriotism and revisionism.<br>During much of its existence, the "living museum" at Williamsburg has been considered a patriotic shrine, celebrating the upscale lifestyles of Virginia&#x2019;s colonial-era elite. But in recent decades a new generation of social historians has injected a more populist and critical slant to the site&#x2019;s narrative of nationhood. For example, in interactions with museum visitors, employees now relate stories about the experiences of African Americans and women, stories that several years ago did not enter into descriptions of life in Colonial Williamsburg. Handler and Gable focus on the way this public history is managed, as historians and administrators define historiographical policy and middle-level managers train and direct front-line staff to deliver this "product" to the public. They explore how visitors consume or modify what they hear and see, and reveal how interpreters and craftspeople resist or acquiesce in being managed. By deploying the voices of these various actors in a richly textured narrative, <i>The New History in an Old Museum</i> highlights the elements of cultural consensus that emerge from this cacophony of conflict and negotiation.<br></p><p>Other reviews of The New History in an Old Museum: <p>"Examining the production of history at such an important organization is a project well worth undertaking, and the authors offer rich insights into the process."(The Journal of Southern History) </p><p>"[Handler and Gable] prove that for all the flash and smoke of the 'culture wars,' for all the radical claims of the new historians and the vicious backlash of their detractors, 'social history has hardly had the kind of insurgent effect its critics claim for it.' . . . Lively and critical."(The Village Voice) </p><p>"Drawing on intensive fieldwork conducted in 1990 and 1991, the authors explore the internal politics of the museum and its foundation and conclude that the record is decidedly mixed." "Nota Bene,"(The Chronicle of Higher Education) </p><p>"[An] accessible and . . . engaging book. . . . [I]t provides valuable insights into how history is presented and why the best intentions go awry."(Publishers Weekly) </p><p>"The scope of their research(which consisted of countless visits to the museum, observation of activities, and extensive research in the museum archives)is truly amazing, and the result is a fascinating book."(Library Journal) </p><p>"Handler and Gable elude the trap that snares most scholars of American culture by refusing to view Williamsburg's version of the American past either as dictated by some nefarious conspiracy that controls the historic site, or by the consumers who pay to visit it. . . . [A] sophisticated account of how a cacophony of voices adds up to little more than white noise."(In These Times) </p><p>"This study goes beyond the scope of most museum research (which seeks to determine the messages that are communicated to visitors), and that is what is most interesting about the book. The New History in an Old Museum explores the museum itself as a multifaceted social system that constructs its own values and transmits those values through its interpretive programs."(Winterthur Portfolio) </p><p>"The New History in an Old Museum is interesting not only for its object of study, but for what it reveals about the mechanisms of history-making; in this regard, Handler and Gable succeed in making constructivism tangible through a specific study. Another important lesson taught by [the book] concerns the university's current struggles with corporatism, and more than a few times, I found disturbing parallels between the "good vibes" consumer satisfaction approach and current trends in higher education. . . . [Recommended] for scholars and students in any of the cultural studies disciplines."(H-Net Reviews) </p><p>"Readers of this study will find new insights into the inner workings of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, and they will learn more about the choices history museums must make to remain viable as both educational institutions and places of entertainment."(Virginia Libraries)</p>&#34;This manuscript is a deep and original work of cultural critique. It will go a long way in improving the image of cultural studies scholarship among historians, anthropologists, and others, who hold it in suspicion. I am sure this study will be much cited as such an exemplar in several fields.&#34;--George E.

If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I <i>am</i> Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure... but as my own being." <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is the only novel of Emily Bronte, who died a year after its publication, at the age of thirty.

It is the story of two sisters, Magdalen and Norah, who discover after the deaths of their dearly beloved parents that the parents were not married at the time of their births. Disinherited and ousted from their estate, they must fend for themselves and either resign themselves to their fate or determine to recover their wealth by whatever means.</p><p>Wilkie Collins&#39;s investigation of illegitimacy and &#39;the woman question&#39; in No Name (1862) compels with a wholly different order of suspense from that of The Woman in White or The Moonstone. For its family secret - the Vanstone daughters&#39; illegitimacy, their consequent disinheritance and fall from social grace - is revealed early on, and as Magdalen Vanstone struggles to reclaim her identity, the plot uncovers many a moral, social and legal skeleton in the cupboards of Victorian society. Mercurial and unscrupulous, Magdalen is Wilkie Collins&#39;s most exhilarating heroine, one of the rare subversives in Victorian fiction and a woman dazzlingly versatile in her powers of self-transformation. Through her, with great comic vigour, No Name exposes how social identity is constructed, and how it can be dismantled, buried, borrowed or invented.<b>Wilkie (William) Collins</b> (1824-89) was a hugely successful and popular crime, mystery and suspense writer. He wrote the first full-length detective novels in English and set a mould for the genre as shown in <i>The Moonstone</i> and "The Woman in White." &nbsp; <br><br><b>Mark Ford</b> is a lecturer in English Literature at University College London.

Written by a renowned authority on forensic science, this text introduces the non-scientific student to the field of forensic science through an exploration of its applications to criminal investigations, and clear explanations of the techniques, abilities and limitations of the modern crime laboratory.</p><p>Richard Saferstein, Ph.D., retired in 1991 after serving 21 years as the Chief Forensic Scientist of the New Jersey State Police Laboratory, one of the largest crime laboratories in the United States. He currently acts as a consultant for attorneys and the media in the area of forensic science. During the O. J. Simpson criminal trial, Dr. Saferstein provided extensive commentary on forensic aspects of the case for the Rivera Live show, the E! television network, ABC radio, and various radio talk shows. Dr. Saferstein holds degrees from the City College of New York and earned his doctorate degree in chemistry in 1970 from the City University of New York. From 1972 to 1991, he taught an introductory forensic science course in the criminal justice programs at the College of New Jersey and Ocean County College. These teaching experiences played an influential role in Dr. Saferstein&#39;s authorship in 1977 of the widely used introductory textbook Criminalastics: An Introduction to Forensic Science, currently in this eighth edition. Saferstein&#39;s basic philosophy in writing Criminalistics is to make forensic science understandable and meaningful to the nonscience reader, while giving the reader an appreciation for the scientific principles that underlie the subject. Dr. Saferstein currently teaches a course on the role of the expert witness in the courtroom at the law school of Widener University in Wilmington, Delaware. He has authored or co-authored more than 35 technical papers covering a variety of forensic topics. Dr. Saferstein has co-authored Lab Manual for Criminalistics (Prentice Hall, 2004) to be used in conjunction with this text. He has also edited the widely used professional reference books Forensic Science Handbook, Volume I, second edition (Prentice Hall, 2002) and Forensic Science Handbook, Volumes II and III (Prentice Hall, 1988, 1993).

I like the theme of the book, which follows that of America At Odds. [And GOVT] helps students to think critically about politics. Basically, everything you could want in a politics textbook is in GOVT.... My greatest limitation is that I do not have enough time during the semester to cover everything. So, knowing that students can rely on the textbook to fill in some of the gaps is very reassuring." - Paul Frank, Sacramento City College<br><br>"I have used other textbooks and am currently using GOVT because of its strengths and courage to address more controversial topics without trying to politicize anything--makes for more interesting reading." - Michaela Fazecas, University of Central Florida<br><br>"I cannot deny the fact that students did not read [my previous textbook] and are reading GOVT.

Her innovative magazine-sponsored initiatives, including <i>House Beautiful</i>&#x2019;s Pace Setter House Program and the Climate Control Project, popularized a &#x201c;livable&#x201d; and decidedly American version of postwar modern architecture. Gordon&#x2019;s devotion to what she called the American Style attracted the attention of Frank Lloyd Wright, who became her ally and collaborator. Gordon&#x2019;s editorial programs reshaped ideas about American living and, by extension, what consumers bought, what designers made, and what manufacturers brought to market. This incisive assessment of&nbsp;Gordon&#x2019;s influence as an editor, critic, and arbiter of domestic taste reflects more broadly on the cultures of consumption and identity in postwar America. Nearly 200 images are featured, including work by Ezra Stoller, Maynard Parker, and Julius Shulman. This important book champions an often-neglected source&#x2014;the consumer magazine&#x2014;as a key tool for deepening our understanding of mid-century architecture and design.</p><p>Examining the enigmatic <i>House Beautiful</i> editor&#x2019;s crusade to reshape postwar American domestic architecture and design, this book offers a fresh perspective on the mechanisms that influenced popular taste at mid-century.<br><b>Monica Penick</b> is assistant professor in the Design Studies Department at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.</p><h2>Cost Accounting: A Managerial Emphasis</h2><p><p><b></b> Horngren&#x2019;s <i>Cost Accounting</i> defined the cost accounting market and continues to innovate today by consistently integrating the most current practice and theory.

This book presents the far-reaching argument that not only should we have a new world order but that we already do. Anne-Marie Slaughter asks us to completely rethink how we view the political world. It's not a collection of nation states that communicate through presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, and the United Nations. Nor is it a clique of NGOs. It is governance through a complex global web of "government networks."</p><br><p> Slaughter provides the most compelling and authoritative description to date of a world in which government officials--police investigators, financial regulators, even judges and legislators--exchange information and coordinate activity across national borders to tackle crime, terrorism, and the routine daily grind of international interactions. National and international judges and regulators can also work closely together to enforce international agreements more effectively than ever before. These networks, which can range from a group of constitutional judges exchanging opinions across borders to more established organizations such as the G8 or the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, make things happen--and they frequently make good things happen. But they are underappreciated and, worse, underused to address the challenges facing the world today.</p><br><p> The modern political world, then, consists of states whose component parts are fast becoming as important as their central leadership. Slaughter not only describes these networks but also sets forth a blueprint for how they can better the world. Despite questions of democratic accountability, this new world order is not one in which some "world government" enforces global dictates. The governments we already have at home are our best hope for tackling the problems we face abroad, in a networked world order.</p></p><p>One of the Times Literary Supplement&#39;s International Books of the Year 2004<p>"One of the most important issues the world must deal with today is how sovereign countries can join together to make globalization work for everyone--not just the privileged. I believe that one way we can start to achieve this is by strengthening the Finance Ministers' G-20, and perhaps advancing a similar concept to the Leaders' level. In October 2003, I met with Anne-Marie Slaughter at a meeting organized by The Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario, where we discussed this concept in great detail. At the roundtable, Ms. Slaughter presented a number of original and innovative ways to bolster the G-20. I was impressed--her ideas were a fresh approach on how the world should govern itself. I believe that it will be her type of intellectual rigour and ingenuity that will bring to fruition new ways to manage our interdependence. Ms. Slaughter's work in global governance is highly regarded amongst international development thinkers and doers. This book, reflecting years of research and experience, is both interesting and timely. As you read, think deeply about the proposed ideas, and how we can use multilateralism to solve issues that single nations cannot solve alone. Greater human understanding is crucial in order to solve complex international problems. Ms. Slaughter has proven to have a clear grasp on how to improve the situation. I urge you to read on."<b>--Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada</b></p><p>"A brilliant analysis of global networks emerging as if guided by an invisible hand. A 'must read' for anyone puzzling over issues of governance on a world scale, Anne-Marie Slaughter's book illustrates important trends that, whether you like them or not, will make you think hard and long."<b>--George P. Shultz, former Secretary of State</b></p><p>"Anne-Marie Slaughter is a visionary, and <i>A New World Order</i> is her manifesto. Even those who have long studied international relations will see the world differently after reading this book."<b>--Robert O. Keohane, James B. Duke Professor of Political Science, Duke University, author of <i>After Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in the World Political Economy</i></b></p><p>"Just when we thought America's postwar multilateralism had run out of steam, along comes this splendid book to offer a cornucopia of prescient forward-thinking about the new ties that bind us to the world."<b>--Thomas M. Franck, New York University School of Law</b></p><p>"Global interdependence requires governance, but we properly fear global government. Anne-Marie Slaughter suggests an innovative solution to the dilemma. Her intelligent and highly readable book describes how global governance can occur through government networks that harness national government officials to address international problems. This book is a major contribution to an important debate."<b>--Joseph S. Nye, Jr., author of <i>The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone</i></b></p><p>"In today's world one sees global networks everywhere, from capital markets to illegal drugs to terrorism. Now government is also going global, writes Anne-Marie Slaughter in this important and original work. Slaughter persuasively documents the rise of an organic international order based not on grand theories of world government but rather day-to-day contacts and communications among governments. She presents a vision of global governance that is practical and yet could have profound normative implications. Going well beyond the traditional confines of international law and international relations, this book will be discussed in both fields for years to come."<b>--Fareed Zakaria, Editor, <i>Newsweek International</i></b></p><p>"In this very ambitious, unique, and clearly written book, Anne-Marie Slaughter not only turns her focus to relatively uncharted territory but she does so with a very systematic and thoughtful analysis of not just what is going on, but why it is going on, and where it is likely to go in the future. No other book does this."<b>--Sean D.

Using mud bricks, the native technique that Fathy learned in Nubia, and such traditional Egyptian architectural designs as enclosed courtyards and vaulted roofing, Fathy worked with the villagers to tailor his designs to their needs. He taught them how to work with the bricks, supervised the erection of the buildings, and encouraged the revival of such ancient crafts as claustra (lattice designs in the mudwork) to adorn the buildings.<b>Hassan Fathy</b>, an Egyptian architect, has taught on the Faculty of Fine Arts in Cairo and served as head of its architectural section. He has received numerous awards including the 1970 French Literary Prize for this book, which originally appeared in a French edition.</p><h2>Kleins Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language</h2><p>Although during the last sixty years philology has attained a high degree of development, looking at the literature available, Etymology appears only to have reached the level of philology at the turn of the century. This dictionary is the first major work of its kind in the 20th century, and as such, embodies the findings of modern philological scholarship. For example, full reference is made to Tocharian, the extinct language rediscovered at the end of the Nineteenth Century which often provides the key to the important transition form between the Old-Indian and the Indo-European group of languages to which English belongs. Several hundred words previously defined as being &#34;of unknown etymology&#34; are fully analyzed.The etymology of words of Semitic origin in the English language is given, the transliteration of Semitic words is based on a concept which renders exactly every consonant, vowel and diacritical sign. Hybrids are not only referred to, but in many cases a new, correctly formed word is suggested. Special attention is paid to loan translations (important elements in the cultural interrelationship between the nations) especially in regard to their passage from one language to another. The dictionary also provides the etymologies of proper and mythological names. Exhaustive cross-referencing, allows the reader to trace all words derived from one and the same base.</p><p>Aside from its outstanding value and importance to students of linguistics, Dr. Klein's work is a source of fascinating reading and browsing to anyone with an interest in language.<br>The American Translators Association Chronicle --The American Translators Association Chronicle</p><h2>The Swiss Family Robinson, For age 8+, (Award Essential Classics)</h2><p><p>A collectable quality hardcover edition of one of the world's most popular and enduring stories.

Working with unforgettable actors like Jean Gabin and Arletty, directors such as Renoir, Carn�, Gremillon, Duvivier, and Chenal routinely captured the prizes for best film at every festival and in every country, and their accomplishments led to general agreement that the French were the first to give maturity to the sound cinema. Here the distinguished film scholar Dudley Andrew examines the motivations and consequences of these remarkable films by looking at the cultural web in which they were made.</p><br><p> Beyond giving a rich view of the life and worth of cinema in France, Andrew contributes substantially to our knowledge of how films are dealt with in history. Where earlier studies have treated the masterpieces of this era either in themselves or as part of the vision of their creators, and where certain recent scholars have reacted to this by dissolving the masterpieces back into the system of entertainment that made them possible, Andrew stresses the dialogue of culture and cinema. In his view, the films open questions that take us into the culture, while our understanding of the culture gives energy, direction, and consequence to our reading of the films. The book demonstrates the value of this hermeneutic approach for one set of texts and one period, but it should very much interest film theorists and film historians of all sorts.</p></p><p><b>Dudley Andrew</b> is Professor of Film Studies at the University of Iowa and the author of numerous works on film theory and the history of film, including <i>Film in the Aura of Art</i> (Princeton)."A perceptive, subtle account of French 'poetic realist' cinema in the 1930s." (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>"Essential reading, this work makes a valuable contribution to scholarly research published on 1930's French cinema, [Well}-researched and informative without being over-scholarly, Andrew's evident enthusiasm for the topic cannot fail to inspire interest and enthusiasm."

This practical, theoretically sophisticated book provides a systematic framework for negotiating ruptures in the alliance and transforming them into therapeutic breakthroughs. The book is grounded in recent developments in relational psychoanalysis, as well as findings from the authors' highly regarded research program. Chapters spell out clear principles of intervention illustrated with extensive clinical vignettes and transcript material. Particular attention is given to the therapist's inner processes and the role they play in resolving alliance ruptures. Other topics covered include the use of therapist self-disclosure and metacommunication; interactional patterns of successful therapist-patient dyads; applications to short-term treatment; and guidelines for training and supervision. <br></p><p>&#34;This book is an unparalleled achievement that transcends many of the usual dichotomies in the field. Structured as a treatment manual, the book elaborates detailed interventions and techniques, but it is also personal and experiential, emphasizing procedural knowledge, self-awareness, and reflection-in-action. It is among the few comprehensive texts that truly integrates ongoing empirical research with cutting-edge developments in clinical psychoanalysis, as well as elements of other therapeutic modalities. It outlines broad theoretical and philosophical principles, yet at the same time provides clear-cut intervention strategies, illustrated with lively and meaningful clinical material. On top of all this it is clearly and engagingly written, well organized, and even includes a creative chapter on the largely unexamined area of training issues and supervision. This book will be used both as a classroom text and as a sourcebook for working clinicians, researchers, and theorists.&#34; Lewis Aron, PhD, Director, Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, New York UniversityJeremy D.

Throughout China&#x2019;s history there has been an ongoing practice of invention and innovation in the forms, materials, decorations, and functions of ceramics made in China, both for the domestic market and for its ever-growing trade with foreign markets. The creation of ceramic ware holds a special and very important place among the many arts and inventions that characterize Chinese culture, society, and civilization.</p><p>The product of a ten-year collaboration among eminent American, Chinese, and Japanese scholars, <i>Chinese Ceramics </i>offers a new perspective in interpreting the oldest and one of the most admired Chinese art forms, from its technological aspects to its aesthetic value.

Some answer specific questions; others muse about the identity shift a woman encounters when she enters Mommyland. This book invites all mothers to join the grand circle of giving and receiving advice about children.</p><p>Beth Ann Fennelly is the author of three poetry collections, Unmentionables, Tender Hooks, and Open House; two memoirs, Heating &amp; Cooling and Great with Child; and a novel, The Tilted World, coauthored with her husband, Tom Franklin. She teaches at the University of Mississippi, and is also the state&#x2019;s Poet Laureate. She lives in Oxford, Mississippi.Poet Fennelly shares, in letters to a formerly pregnant friend, the joys and sorrows of pregnancy and motherhood. Fennelly's letters read like prose, but they're also loaded with information on all aspects of pregnancy-cravings, fear of childbirth, anxieties over health and a changing body-as well as insights on relationships and child rearing. In one letter, she shares a powerful and personal story about how "family secrets...have a way of rotting a family's foundation," and in another she writes about the pleasant surprise of discovering that motherhood "is tremendously sweet, which we all know; it's also tremendously funny, which isn't so well recognized." The letters are arranged chronologically, so the topics ebb and flow according to Fennelly's moods and daily experiences, so the letter celebrating her daughter's victory over potty training is followed by a letter revealing "the erotics of motherhood," which is followed by a treatise on maintaining a tranquil home after baby's arrival. Expecting and new mothers looking for short doses of inspiration will find a year's worth here.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Schlesinger's remarkable journey began in 1966 when as an 18-year-old student at UCLA he met the artist David Hockney. The two moved to London, where Schlesinger was introduced to the city's fashionable bohemian society. There, as well as on trips, Schlesinger met and photographed some of the great personalities of the day, including Cecil Beaton, Paloma Picasso, Grace Coddington, Tina Chow, Christopher Isherwood and Manolo Blahnik, to name just a few. This beautifully produced book presents an overview of 30 years of photographic work from Schlesinger's archives. In addition to intimate portraits, it includes Schlesinger's evocative still lifes, which convey the romance, humor and elegance of their time. This is the first monograph to present the full range of Schlesinger's photographic work.<br><b>Peter Schlesinger</b> was born and raised in California.

Gathering his evil band around him, Slagar plots to strike at the heart of the Abbey. His cunning and cowardly plan is to steal the Redwall children -- and Mattimeo, Matthias&#39;s son, is to be the biggest prize of all.</p><p>Preparations for the feast for the Summer of the Golden Rain are underway at Redwall Abbey, and young Mattimeo's mother sets him to work with the other inhabitants. His father, Matthius, is the guardian of Redwall Abbey and it is this fact that puts the young Mattimeo in danger, as the evil Slagar the Fox plots to kidnap him in a bid to shake the very foundations of the Abbey and its inhabitants. <p> Rip-roaring adventure at its very best, Mattimeo is one of the exquisitely executed and totally bewitching tales in the best-selling Redwall series. Brian Jacques, with his masterly use of language and enviable talent for descriptive prose that transports the reader to the very heart of Redwall, magically weaves an epic tale breathtaking in proportion and design.

Because Beckett has a reputation for being difficult, even obscure, readers of the trilogy are bound to be struck not only by the verbal brilliance and inventiveness of the three novels, but also by their extraordinary humour which ranges from wit to broad comedy and even farce in a recognizably Irish way. Each story records an episode of human endurance in the face of metaphysical adversity with compassion and wisdom and each is a compelling narrative in itself in the great tradition of European fiction from Flaubert to Joyce.</p><p></p><h2>The Digital Matte Painting Handbook</h2><p><b>The only how-to guide dedicated to mastering the technique of digital matte painting!</b> <p>Matte painting affords seamless integration between an artist&#x2019;s painting with live action film footage and allows for greater flexibility and creative input in the appearance of movie settings.

Hall returns to this powerful territory in The Best Day the Worst Day, a work of prose that is equally "a work of art, love, and generous genius" (Liz Rosenberg, Boston Globe).<br> Jane Kenyon was nineteen years younger than Donald Hall and a student poet at the University of Michigan when they met. Hall was her teacher. The Best Day the Worst Day is an intimate account of their twenty-three-year marriage, nearly all of it spent in New Hampshire at Eagle Pond Farm &#x2014; of their shared rituals of writing, close attention to pets and gardening, and love in the afternoon. Hall joyfully records Jane's growing power as a poet and the couple's careful accommodations toward each other as writers. This portrait of the inner moods of "the best marriage I know about," as Hall has written, is laid against the stark medical emergency of Jane's leukemia, which ended her life in fifteen months. Hall shares with readers &#x2014; as if we were one of the grieving neighbors, friends, and relatives &#x2014; the daily ordeal of Jane's dying, through heartbreaking and generous storytelling.<br> The Best Day the Worst Day stands alongside Elegy to Iris as a powerful testimony to both loss and love.</p><p>DONALD HALL, poet laureate of the United States from 2006 to 2007, has received the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in poetry, the Lenore Marshall Award, the 1990 Frost Medal from the Poetry Society of America, and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters."Jane Kenyon died of leukemia at 7:57 in the morning, April 22, 1995" is the first sentence of this unsparing and beautifully structured memoir. She was only 47, and the struggle was harrowing, but it followed 23 years of an extraordinarily happy marriage between poets, blissful despite the difference in their ages (19 years; she had been his student), and her illness and chronic clinical depression. Alternating with the meticulous account of the progress of Kenyon's disease are warm, joyful chapters as Hall recalls their time together. They lived quietly in a New Hampshire farmhouse that had been in Hall's family for generations, "the house of poetry, which was also the house of love and grief; the house of solitude and art; the house of Jane's depression and my cancers and Jane's leukemia." As increasingly famous poets, Hall and Kenyon traveled, on reading tours around America and abroad. Hall's impressions of China, Japan and especially India, which they both loved, make vivid reading. Also glowing are the portraits of friends, relatives and the caregivers who crowded into their lives. Hall wrote about Kenyon's illness and death in his 1998 book of poems, <i>Without</i>, but this heartfelt memoir should reach people who seldom read poetry and could be a natural for reading groups. <i>Agent, Gerald McCauley.

Trita Parsi, a Middle East foreign policy expert who advised the Obama White House throughout the talks and had access to decision-makers and diplomats on the U.S. and Iranian sides alike, examines every facet of a triumph that could become as important and consequential as Nixon&#x2019;s rapprochement with China. Drawing from more than seventy-five in-depth interviews with key decision-makers, including Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, this is the first authoritative account of President Obama&#x2019;s signature foreign policy achievement.</p><p><b>What does the title &#x201c;Losing an Enemy&#x201d; signify? Has the nuclear deal truly transformed U.S.-Iran relations?</b> <br> &nbsp; <br> I chose the title for two reasons. First, though the U.S. and Iran remain at odds, the nuclear deal has turned them from lethal enemies to mere rivals. That is quite significant because it shows the transformative potential of the nuclear deal&#x2014;a potential I argue is slipping out of our hands. Secondly, the intense fight around the nuclear deal revealed how strong the forces are&#x2014;in Washington and in Tehran&#x2014;who don&#x2019;t want to lose an enemy. Who fear peace more than they fear war. This deal was ultimately less about nuclear details and more about whether we were ready to close the chapter of enmity. <br> &nbsp; <br> <b>It&#x2019;s a story about war vs. peace?</b> <br> &nbsp; <br> It&#x2019;s a story about how to make peace, an art that we have largely lost. It&#x2019;s about the secret mediation of the tiny Sultanate of Oman, whose deft and largely unrevealed maneuvering saved the U.S. from yet another disastrous war. Most Americans don&#x2019;t know, I fear, how close we were to war and how difficult and taxing diplomacy is. Mindful of our turbulent times, I am hoping that this book will help us rediscover that art form. <br> &nbsp; <br> <b>But it is also a book that delves into both historic analysis and contemporary politics? </b> <br> <br> Yes, it provides both a historical analysis of the geopolitical context that made the nuclear deal with Iran so critical (and of why Israel and Saudi Arabia so vehemently opposed it) as well as an inside account of the Obama administration&#x2019;s biggest foreign policy fight with Congress&#x2014;and how Obama won it against all odds. I interviewed top decision-makers on all sides in the negotiations, including Iran&#x2019;s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, and I also had a front row seat to the political fight in Congress, all of which helped me weave the story together.<b>Trita Parsi</b> is president of the National Iranian American Council.

They share their knitting triumphs and disasters as well as their life triumphs and disasters. . . . These essays will break your heart. They will have you laughing out loud.&#x201d;&#x2015;Ann Hood, from the introduction <p>Why does knitting occupy a place in the hearts of so many writers? What&#x2019;s so magical and transformative about yarn and needles? How does knitting help us get through life-changing events and inspire joy? In <em>Knitting Yarns</em>, twenty-seven writers tell stories about how knitting healed, challenged, or helped them to grow. Barbara Kingsolver describes sheering a sheep for yarn. Elizabeth Berg writes about her frustration at failing to knit. Ann Patchett traces her life through her knitting, writing about the scarf that knits together the women she&#x2019;s loved and lost. Knitting a Christmas gift for his blind aunt helped Andre Dubus III knit an understanding with his girlfriend. Kaylie Jones finds the woman who used knitting to help raise her in France and heals old wounds. Sue Grafton writes about her passion for knitting. Also included are five original knitting patterns created by Helen Bingham.</p><p>Poignant, funny, and moving, <em>Knitting Yarns</em> is sure to delight knitting enthusiasts and lovers of literature alike.</p></p><p>Ann Hood is the author of eight previous books, including the best-selling memoir Comfort: A Journey Through Grief and best-selling novels The Book That Matters Most and The Knitting Circle. She lives in Providence, Rhode Island.This is a collection of essays and one poem by well-known authors about the magical powers of knitting. The book also includes six knitting patterns interspersed throughout the book. Because the focus of the text is on the act of knitting and the feelings evoked rather than the finished product, there are no images or diagrams to accompany the knitting projects. Rather, the text invites the reader to curl up with a book or with knitting and be transported to a world of healing, peace, and calm. These are deeply personal stories ranging from true and heartbreaking (Martha Frankel attempting to keep her friend from joining a cult through knitting), to the honest and humorous (finger knitting being even more relaxing than knitting because you can drink your martini while finger knitting). This book makes you want to start knitting or resurrect an old knitting project. --Rebecca Pfenning</p><h2>The Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movie</h2><p>The creator of &#34;Animal House&#34; at last tells the real story of the fraternity that inspired the iconic film--a story far more outrageous and funny than any movie could ever capture.</p><p>Chris Miller is a screenwriter who was the story-writer in residence at National Lampoon for 25 years. A former ad man responsible for coining such phrases as &#34;I&#39;m cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!,&#34; he now lives in Venice, California.Alpha Delta Phi of Dartmouth College is the fraternity on which the movie ANIMAL HOUSE was based. Miller's account of the organization's exploits during his sophomore year in the early 1960s delivers even more debauchery and depravity than its movie namesake. Listeners won't know whether to laugh or cry (with disgust). Initially, Todd McLaren's dry voice seems a poor match, but by the end of the first hour listeners fall into step with his cadence and style. McLaren's matter-of-fact tone makes the bizarre stories that much zanier. He even executes the musical cues within the text impressively. However, his vocal characterizations often sound more like impersonations than actual people.

In Seth Speaks, Seth introduced the concept of &#34;probable realities,&#34; in which our idle daydreams and unfulfilled impulses do take place, in which all possible choices are fully experienced by other portions of the self. Now, in this first volume of The &#34;Unknown&#34; Reality, Seth explains the dazzling labyrinths of unseen probabilities involved in any decision, and how our awareness of these can enrich the waking life we know. In a fascinating exploration of the cosmic web of our existence, Seth reveals: * The purpose of dreams, and how they are often fulfilled unconsciously; * Misconceptions about death and the afterlife; * How different probable realities intersect and influence one another; * The relationship between physical health and inner reality; * A series of exercises to help you discover the unknown portions of your greater identity. In Volume One of The &#34;Unknown&#34; Reality, Seth initiates a journey in which it seems that the familiar is left behind. Where do the events of our lives begin or end? Where do we fit into them, individually and as members of the species? These questions, with Seth&#39;s explanations, are the heart of Volume One.</p><p>Roberts was considered one of the most important psychics of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Eric Kroll&#39;s Fetish Girls</h2><p>Used.

He lives in Lexington, Massachusetts. Donaldo Macedo is professor of English and Distinguished Professor of Liberal Arts and Education at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. He is the author of many books, including Literacies of Power and the forthcoming Ideology Matters, coauthored with Paulo Freire.Chomsky and Macedo provide a brilliant analysis of schooling that draws upon a language of critique and possibility that reclaims the notion of schooling as a public good and a democratic force. At a time when teachers, students, and public life in general are under assault by the juggernaut of commodification and capital accumulation, it is crucial that educators, parents, youth, and others be offered a language in which politics, power, justice, and social change become central to any notion of educational reform. Chomsky and Macedo's book fulfills this task with great courage and penetrating wisdom. This is a book that should be read by everyone interested in education and the crisis of democracy. (Henry A. Giroux, McMaster University Chair for Scholarship in the Public Interest)<br><br>Judged in terms of power, range, novelty, and influence of his thought, Noam Chomsky is arguably the most important intellectual alive today.

(Christopher Lehmann-Haupt <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>[Chomsky has] a proud defensive independence, a good plain writer's hatred of expert mystification, a doctrine of resistance which runs against the melioristic and participatory current of most contemporary intellectual life. . . .

With vivid power, Wharton evokes a time of gaslit streets, formal dances held in the ballrooms of stately brownstones, and society people &#34;who dreaded scandal more than disease.&#34; This is Newland Archer&#39;s world as he prepares to marry the docile May Welland. Then, suddenly, the mysterious, intensely nonconformist Countess Ellen Olenska returns to New York after a long absence and Newland Archer&#39;s world is never the same. Edith Wharton&#39;s classic tale of thwarted love is an exuberantly comic and profoundly moving look at the passions of the human heart. The San Francisco Examiner says, &#34;Wharton&#39;s characters leap out from the pages and ... become very real. You know their hearts, souls, and yearnings, and the price they pay for those yearnings.&#34; An unforgettable comedy of manners and morals, The Age of Innocence is a literary achievement of the highest order.</p><p>Somewhere in this book, Wharton observes that clever liars always come up with good stories to back up their fabrications, but that really clever liars don't bother to explain anything at all. This is the kind of insight that makes <i>The Age of Innocence </i> so indispensable. Wharton's story of the upper classes of Old New York, and Newland Archer's impossible love for the disgraced Countess Olenska, is a perfectly wrought book about an era when upper-class culture in this country was still a mixture of American and European extracts, and when "society" had rules as rigid as any in history.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

People could seek knowledge from the dead by sleeping on tombs, visiting oracles, and attempting to reanimate corpses and skulls. Ranging over many of the lands in which Greek and Roman civilizations flourished, including Egypt, from the Greek archaic period through the late Roman empire, this book is the first comprehensive survey of the subject ever published in any language.</p><br><p> Daniel Ogden surveys the places, performers, and techniques of necromancy as well as the reasons for turning to it. He investigates the cave-based sites of oracles of the dead at Heracleia Pontica and Tainaron, as well as the oracles at the Acheron and Avernus, which probably consisted of lakeside precincts. He argues that the Acheron oracle has been long misidentified, and considers in detail the traditions attached to each site. Readers meet the personnel--real or imagined--of ancient necromancy: ghosts, zombies, the earliest vampires, evocators, sorcerers, shamans, Persian magi, Chaldaeans, Egyptians, Roman emperors, and witches from Circe to Medea. Ogden explains the technologies used to evocate or reanimate the dead and to compel them to disgorge their secrets. He concludes by examining ancient beliefs about ghosts and their wisdom--beliefs that underpinned and justified the practice of necromancy.</p><br><p> The first of its kind and filled with information, this volume will be of central importance to those interested in the rapidly expanding, inherently fascinating, and intellectually exciting subjects of ghosts and magic in antiquity.</p></p><p><p>"This study fills a gaping hole in the scholarship, and it is sorely needed. The fascinating material it covers has never been collected and discussed in one volume, in spite of the current surge of interest in ancient magic and its intersection with religion.

How the Police Generate False Confessions takes you inside the interrogation room, exposing the tactics that law enforcement uses to make confessions happen. <br><br>James L. Trainum reveals how innocent people can become suspects and then confessed criminals even when they have not committed a crime. Using real stories, he looks at the inherent coerciveness of the interrogation process and why so many false confessions contain so many of the details that only the true perpetrator would know. More disturbingly, the book examines how these same processes corrupt witness and victim statements, create lying informants and cooperators, and induce innocent people to plead guilty. Trainum also offers recommendations for change in the U.S. by looking at how other countries are changing the process to prevent such miscarriages of justice. <br><br>The reasons that people falsely confess can be complex and varied; throughout How the Police Generate False Confessions Trainum encourages readers to critically evaluate confessions on their own by gaining a better understanding of the interrogation process.</p><p>James L. Trainum, a private consultant, retired from the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. and was the Violent Crimes Case Review Project Director- Detective from 2000-2010. He was the recipient of the Marymount University Forensic Psychology Program Award in Ethics in Law Enforcement in 2005, and recipient of the 2009 Innocence Network&#x2019;s Champion of Justice Award. Trainum has written several articles on interrogations and the creation of Innocence Commissions, committees designed to review alleged wrongful conviction cases. He has been interviewed on the topic of interrogation and false confessions by The New Yorker, The New York Times, and National Public Radio. Trainum has also been quoted in the American Psychological Associations white paper on the topic of false confessions and in numerous other articles and editorials. He speaks at many conferences and other events to talk about the topic of false confessions and interrogation techniques.In this groundbreaking book on the U.S. criminal justice system, Trainum, a former Washington, D.C. police detective, argues for reform of police interviewing and interrogation practices. The confession is considered the gold standard for law enforcement, because 'most people believe that they would never confess to a crime they did not do.' Yet suspects, witnesses, and informants often feel that they have no other option. Trainum carefully demonstrates why in an era of minimum sentences, where the worst-case scenario can be significant jail time, registration as a sex offender, or even the death penalty, prosecutors have breathtaking power to hold a person's life in the balance. The best option for a suspect or witness may be a false confession, informing, or a plea bargain, especially when a long legal fight may drain a family bank account, or when a prosecutor offers a reduced sentence or jailhouse privileges as reward. Without reform, prosecutors, police, and investigators may soon discover that 'harsh and verbally abusive interrogation tactics that focused solely on obtaining confessions... not only [contribute] to false confessions but also to the negative perception of law enforcement by the public.' Using numerous examples and backed by persuasive academic research, Trainum proposes a better way that is already at work in countries with similar criminal justice systems. His book will hit a nerve with a public newly concerned with abuses of police power, and hopefully will influence those tasked with law enforcement and public policy as well. (<i>Publishers Weekly, Starred Review</i>)<br><br>The first step to solving any problem is realizing that it exists. This enlightening work by retired Washington, DC, police detective Trainum leaves no doubt that there are complications with false confessions and police interrogation techniques. Trainum walks readers through the steps police are taught to use in the interrogation room and the coercive methods that can lead to contamination of the interview and false confession. His explanations are well supported with relevant and interesting case studies and previous research. He includes information on problems with statements from witnesses and informants and the role played by plea bargains and mandatory sentences. After presenting a thoroughly convincing portrait of the issue, Trainum provides 'a better way' forward, outlining the PEACE method of interrogation and reviewing other safeguards, including videotaping of interviews. His 27 years of experience provide an insider's realistic, practical view, making this an especially important addition on the topic. VERDICT Essential for those working in the criminal justice system. It will also be of interest to the general public concerned with criminal justice issues and reform, as well as fans of police procedurals and true crime. (<i>Library Journal, Starred Review</i>)<br><br>[I]f you have an interest in fairness, justice and preventing wrongful convictions, then the new book How the Police Generate False Confessions by former Washington, D.C., homicide detective James Trainum is an important read. It takes you inside the interrogation room to see how investigators extract admissions from innocent people, and how the justice system can fix this persistent problem, seen in high profile cases such as the Central Park Five, the Norfolk Four and the teenaged suspect from Wisconsin in the Netflix series &#x2018;Making a Murderer.&#x2019;... I [Washington Post reporter Tom Jackman] asked Brandon Garrett, a University of Virginia law professor who has focused on wrongful convictions, about Trainum&#x2019;s book. &#x2018;It is such an important new book,&#x2019; Garrett said. &#x2018;For decades, we have seen false confession after false confession lead to tragic wrongful convictions of the innocent while serious criminals go undetected. The courts have done little to respond to abuses in the interrogation room; if anything they have eroded constitutional protections, such as the right to remain silent. Trainum explains that for police, there is another way. Overly coercive interrogation techniques not only produce false confessions but they are not good at uncovering good information. In the U.K. and in more agencies in the U.S., police have changed gears, turning from psychologically coercive techniques to information gathering techniques. Trainum and his book are at the forefront of a revolution in police interrogations.&#x2019; Now that&#x2019;s a lot better book review quote than mine. (<i>The Washington Post</i>)<br><br>Who could falsely confess to a crime they didn&#x2019;t do? In this must read book, Trainum gives us the inside story. He shows how shockingly easy it is for police to secure a false confession, even without intending to do so. That confession, though false, may appear to be highly accurate. Trainum concludes by pointing the way towards less coercive interrogation methods. The result will be a revolution in police questioning. (Brandon L. Garrett, Justice Thurgood Marshall Distinguished Professor of Law, University of Virginia School of Law)<br><br>This is not a book about bad cops; it is a book about a very good cop discovering a process for making himself a great cop: beginning by calmly confronting his own mistakes, using research to understand their lessons, and then sharing those lessons with the justice professions. A tremendous contribution. (James Doyle, Attorney, Boston, MA; author of True Witness: Cops, Courts, Science and the Battle Against Misidentification)<br><br>False confessions are a leading cause of wrongful convictions. Jim Trainum, a retired Washington, DC, homicide detective, explores the nature of this problem in his book, How the Police Generate False Confessions, and discusses how the interview process can be improved and reformed. Investigators, prosecutors, and defense attorneys will all benefit from his experience and insights. (D. Kim Rossmo, Professor, School of Criminal Justice at Texas State University)<br><br>The curtain is being drawn back on the interrogation room, and America doesn&#x2019;t necessarily like what it sees. This is being led by those who are willing to discuss what they know about interrogation practices and the unjust outcomes that happen as a result. Jim Trainum is one of those voices, detailing not only issues related to interrogations and false confessions, but the larger investigative culture that can make changing this situation very difficult. The first step to change is admitting you have a problem. Law enforcement has not come around to this realization. In this book, however, the problem becomes clear. Through historical examples and personal experience as a Detective, Jim takes the reader on a journey through the various ways in which a false confession can happen, and does happen. In the end, the reader is left with the realization that what happens in the interrogation room is in large part a reflection of our criminal justice system itself. As a result of this knowledge, we are faced with the choice about whether we want the system to change, or to remain as it is. In making this decision, the reader comes to realize that the next false confession that is given might very well be your own, and that no one is necessarily immune from the forces of persuasion and coercion that exist in the interrogation. (Gary C. David, PhD, Associate Professor of Sociology, Department Chair; Associate Professor of Information Design and Corporate Communication, Bentley University)<br><br>Blending his career as a decorated homicide detective with his uncanny academic insights and understanding Jim has given us a book that addresses the complicated issues inherent in police interview and interrogations with piercing precision and unique insights. This is a must-read for practitioners, academicians and anyone interested in what really happens when cops, suspects, policies and the law converge in a pressure-filled interview room. Not to be missed. (Gregg O. McCrary, FBI, retired)<br><br>Others have written books about how police generate false confessions. Richard Ofshe, Saul Kassin, Richard Leo (Laura Nirider and I) and many others frequently lecture about the causes and consequences of false confessions. But it is one thing for social scientists, academics, and defense attorneys to write and talk about these things, it is another for a homicide detective to do so. Jim Trainum's book, How the Police Generate False Confessions: An Inside Look at the Interrogation Room, may just turn out to be the most important book on the subject ever written. I learned more about the way police officers investigate homicides and the way tunnel vision and confirmation bias leads to investigative failure from this book than from any other book I have read. The book puts a lie to so many myths about police interrogations that I lost count of them all. But it does so much more. Det. Trainum is not just a critic; he is a reformer, charting a course for the proper way for police officers to investigate cases, interview suspects, witnesses and informants and to obtain reliable information from them. If you buy one book this year in the area of wrongful convictions, this is the book you should buy.

Since the Diary does not cover this period, the letters enable the reader to follow Pepys&#39; early career on the staff of the Earl of Sandwich, his rise to greatness as Secretary of the Admiralty, and his retirement after the Glorious Revolution. Along the way Pepys fought battles with opponents of his naval reforms and enemies who tried to implicate him in the Popish Plot, while taking care of his various relatives and keeping up with an array of friends and acquaintances who included many of the great and famous of late-seventeenth-century England. The letters have been chosen to reflect all these aspects of Pepys&#39;s varied and fascinating life, and include 30 never before published. They are accompanied by a running commentary, biographies of persons mentioned, a glossary, a chronology, and an introduction that explains how the letters have survived and analyses how they were written.

Most are also concerned with the structure of narrative, including the present novel, in which Woolf conveys the impression of time present and of time passing in individual experience as well as in the characters' awareness of historic time.<br>Considered Woolf's first original and distinguished work, <i>Jacob's Room</i> (1922) concerns a sensitive young man, Jacob Flanders, who finds himself unable to reconcile his love of classical culture with the chaotic reality of World War I. His story unfolds in a series of brief impressions and conversations, stream-of-consciousness narratives, internal monologues, and letters.<br>This inexpensive edition of Woolf's intense and affecting novel offers readers a first-rate example of subtle style and innovative techniques for which the author is admired.</p><p></p></p><p>First published in 1922, Jacobs Room was Virginia Woolfs third novel and the first in her more experimental mode. Set in the years leading up to the First World War, the work is an elegy, not just for an individual character, but for a generation lost in and affected by the war.This Shakespeare Head Press edition restores the text to its original form, notably recreating the space breaks on the page with which Woolf deliberately fragmented her narrative. The editor provides an extensive introduction, discussing the genesis of the novel, its biographical elements, the process of composition and revision, and the history of its early critical reception. A series of notes helps the reader to identify references and allusions, from sponge-bag trousers and gold beaters skin to Tonks and Steer, and the Hampstead Garden Suburbs; while an appendix lists variants between the first UK and first US editions of the work.Virginia Woolf's first original and distinguished work, <i>Jacob's Room</i> is the story of a sensitive young man named Jacob Flanders. The life story, character and friends of Jacob are presented in a series for separate scenes and moments from his childhood, through college at Cambridge, love affairs in London, and travels in Greece, to his death in the war. <i>Jacob's Room</i> established Virginia Woolf's reputation as a highly poetic and symbolic writer who places emphasis not on plot or action but on the psychological realm of occupied by her characters.</p><h2>Picasso: Blue and Rose Periods</h2><p><p><b>Charting Picasso&#x2019;s journey from the bohemians of the Blue Period to the Rose Period&#x2019;s acrobats and ingenues, this book celebrates some of the 20th century&#x2019;s most beloved masterpieces</b><br>Published for the most ambitious exhibition ever staged by the Fondation Beyeler, this book is devoted to the paintings and sculptures of the young Pablo Picasso (1881&#x2013;1973) from the so-called Blue and Rose periods, between 1901 and 1906. The masterpieces of these crucial years, every one of them a milestone on Picasso's path to preeminence as the 20th century's most famous artist, are presented together, in an unparalleled concentration and quality. Picasso's pictures from this phase are some of the finest and most emotionally compelling examples of modern painting, and are counted among the most valuable works in the entire history of art.<br> Throughout the Blue period, Picasso depicted the material deprivation and psychological suffering of people on the margins of society, before turning, in 1905 (when he had settled in Paris), to the themes of the Rose period: jugglers, acrobats and harlequins. In the summer of 1906, Picasso spent several weeks in the Spanish Pyrenees, where he produced a profusion of paintings and sculptures uniting classical and archaic ideals of the body. His increasing deformation and fragmentation of the figure throughout this period&#x2015;apparent in the "primitivist" pictures, especially the female nudes&#x2015;heralded the emergence of the new pictorial language of cubism.<br> The works of the Blue and Rose periods have a universal appeal and poignancy. Existential themes&#x2015;life, love, sexuality, fate and death&#x2015;find embodiment in the delicate beauty of young female and male figures, and in depictions of children and of old people scarred by life, whose rendering by Picasso shows happiness and joy, but also loneliness and melancholy.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Book Of Ogham : The Celtic Tree Oracle</h2><p>This book presents the complete and authentic system of divination based on the letters of the Celtic ogham alphabet (commonly designated by tree names).

Its focus, on ordinary Christians, distinguishes it from other studies of Reformation iconoclasm. Its concern, to recover their agency in Reformation and to discern their theology in acts, may be of interest to scholars in American history, anthropology, and religious studies.</p><p>An effort to recover the participation of ordinary Christians in the enterprise of Reformation through an exploration of the meaning of acts of iconoclasm: what they tell us about the role of images in Christianity and about ordinary people&#39;s theologies.This book takes up iconoclasm, that mode by which hundreds of ordinary people entered into &#34;Reformation&#34;, in three important towns of the 1520s. It seeks to recover the agency of ordinary people in Reformation and to discern their theology in their acts. In part, its purpose is to suggest ways of excavating the meaning of the acts of those who did not have access to more protected and fixed forms of communication - that is, printed texts and images. In part, it illuminates the meaning of images for ordinary Christians in the sixteenth century. Voracious Idols and Violent Hands posits a vision of &#34;Reformation&#34; as a dialogue in which different persons &#34;spoke&#34; through different forms, according to their education and social and political place. Each brought his or her vision of true Christianity to that dialogue, and articulated that vision in the cultural form he or she found most accessible: theologians in sermons and treatises, magistrates in laws and their enforcement, and ordinary people - the focus of this volume - in acts.</p><h2>Mountain Dance</h2><p>Listen. The earth seems still and quiet, but constantly, silently, it is moving and changing.<br> <i>Mountain Dance</i> takes readers from summit to shore, and into the depths of the earth, exploring the geographic forces it takes to move, build, and wear away the great peaks and valleys of our planet. Thomas Locker's poetic text and exquisitely detailed paintings reveal fascinating details of geology in this beautiful and inspiring introduction to earth science. <br></p><p>THOMAS LOCKER has written and illustrated many award-winning books for children, including the companion titles Water Dance and Mountain Dance. He lives in Stuyvesant, New York.K-Gr 4-Locker combines near-perfect oil paintings with small bits of thoughtful poetry to create a book that readers will return to for many different reasons. He tells the story of geologic evolution throughout eternity in a majestic, awe-inspiring manner. His verse describes the various types of mountains; how they were created by wind, fire, and water; and how these mountains "dance" throughout time. The verses and paintings complement each other perfectly-the description Locker creates for each type of mountain is centered on the page directly across from its painting. Readers can feel the heat from volcanoes and watch ice from glaciers melt and cascade down sloping hills. The book ends with thumbnail sketches of the mountains and additional text for those who would like to know more. The vast array of information contained in a simple format with paintings that are true to life make this a monumental book that will be used equally successfully in a storytime or in a unit on geology.<p></p><p><i>Susan Marie Pitard, formerly at Weezie Library for Children, Nantucket Atheneum, MA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Sturgis&#39; Illustrated Dictionary of Architecture and Building: An Unabridged Reprint of the 1901-2 Edition, Vol. III: O-Z</h2><p>Volume 3 of monumental 3-volume classic offers comprehensive and detailed coverage of architectural terms, individuals and national styles.

After a bit of research, the Arduino seemed like the obvious choice, and the cloud detector was successfully made, quickly and cheaply. Mike s fascination with the Arduino had begun. Since then he has gone on to make countless projects using the Arduino. He had also founded an Arduino starter kit and component online business called Earthshine Electronics. His next project is to use an Arduino-based circuit to send a high altitude balloon up to the edge of space to take stills and video for the heck of it, with the help of the guys from the U.K. High Altitude Society and CUSF. Mike s hobby of electronics began as a child when the 100-in-1 electronics kits from Radio Shack made up his Christmas present list. He started programming as a hobby when he obtained a Sinclair ZX81 computer as a teenager. Since then, he s never been without a computer. Recently, he s become a Mac convert. He is a member of London Hackspace and the Orpington Astronomical Society and can regularly be found contributing to the Arduino Forum. He also likes to lurk on IRC in the Arduino, high altitude and london-hack-space channels (as earthshine ), and on Twitter @TheArduinoGuy. When he is not messing around with Arduinos or running Earthshine Electronics, he likes to indulge in astronomy, astrophotography, motorcycling, and sailing.</p><h2>The Art of Computer Programming, Vols. 1-3</h2><p>For the first time in more than 20 years, Knuth has revised all three books to reflect more recent developments in the field.

Neurofeedback is founded upon computer technology joined with auxiliary equipment that can measure the metabolic activity of the cerebral cortex.</strong></p> Neurofeedback training combines the principles of complementary medicine with the power of electronics. It is a comprehensive system that promotes growth change at the cellular level of the brain and empowers the client to use his or her mind as a tool for personal healing.Until now, there has not been a single comprehensive yet easy-to-understand guide for clinicians interested in adding neurotherapy to their practice. <em>Getting Started with Neurofeedback</em> is a step-by-step guide for professional health care providers who wish to begin with neurotherapy, as well as experienced clinicians who are looking for a concise treatment guide.This book answers essential questions such as: How does neurotherapy work?, What is the rationale for treatment? When is neurotherapy the treatment of choice? Why should I add it to my already existing healthcare practice? The author also answers questions important to establishing a successful practice such as: What kind of training should clinicians get? What kind of equipment should clinicians buy? How can clinicians add neurofeedback to their existing practice?The first part of the book introduces the reader to the world of neurofeedback, its history and scientific basis. Case studies help clinicians apply what they are learning to their existing practice. Demos takes the mystery out of the assessment process and charts and examples of topographical brain maps (in full color) serve as teaching aids. Later in the book, advanced techniques are explained and demonstrated by additional case studies. The reader is shown how to use biofeedback for the body to augment neurofeedback training as well as being taught to work with the body and acquire a basic knowledge of complementary medicine.The book concludes by offering clinicians practical suggestions on marketing their expanded practice, purchasing equipment, finding appropriate training and supervision, and keeping up with the ever-growing profession of neurofeedback. Research and theory unite to demonstrate the clinical underpinnings for this exciting new modality.</p><p>John N. Demos, MA, LCMHC, BCIA-EEG, is the Clinical Director of Neurofeedback of Southern Vermont, a complementary therapies clinic located in Brattleboro, VT. He is a licensed clinical mental health counselor and is certified in the field of EEG-biofeedback. He is also a member of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback as well as of the International Society for Neuronal Regulation.&#x201c;In this very accessible book, <em>Getting Started with Neurofeedback</em>, John N. Demos goes a long way toward removing the barriers that keep clinicians from implementing an emerging form of computerized brain technology into their practices... [P]rovides lucid explanations of the mechanisms underlying neurofeedback as well as the research history that led to its implementation. His description of neurofeedback equipment is more understandable than the descriptions supplied by software and hardware manufacturers. Perhaps most impressive are the images of brain function that depict EEG characteristics of common psychological disorders... By making the basics of neurofeedback accessible in one well-written volume, he has provided an invaluable service to psychologists and clients alike.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Activities, Adaptation, and Aging</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I highly recommend <em>Getting Started with Neurofeedback</em> as a basic and comprehensive text for students entering the field of neurofeedback, and as a basic reference for those already in practice.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Journal of Neurotherapy</em></strong></p><h2>Laboratory Manual for Chemistry: A Molecular Approach (4th Edition)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Chemistry Laboratory.</i> </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p>With a focus on real-world applications and a conversational tone, this laboratory manual contains experiments written specifically to correspond with <b> <i>Chemistry: A Molecular Approach</i>, Fourth Edition</b> by Nivaldo J.

Many of his theories and practices were the basis for medical knowledge for centuries after his death and some practices&#x2015;like checking a patient&#x2019;s pulse&#x2015;are still used today. He also left a vast corpus of writings which makes up a full one-eighth of all surviving ancient Greek literature. Through her readings of hundreds of Galen&#x2019;s case histories, Susan P. Mattern presents the first systematic investigation of Galen&#x2019;s clinical practice. </p><p>Galen&#x2019;s patient narratives illuminate fascinating interplay among the craft of healing, social class, professional competition, ethnicity, and gender. Mattern describes the public, competitive, and masculine nature of medicine among the urban elite and analyzes the relationship between clinical practice and power in the Roman household. She also finds that although Galen is usually perceived as self-absorbed and self-promoting, his writings reveal him as sensitive to the patient&#x2019;s history, symptoms, perceptions, and even words. </p><p>Examining his professional interactions in the context of the world in which he lived and practiced, <i>Galen and the Rhetoric of Healing</i> provides a fresh perspective on a foundational figure in medicine and valuable insight into how doctors thought about their patients and their practice in the ancient world.</p></p><p><p><b>Susan P.

It reveals the sinister forces that, towards the end of his life, Twain thought to be threatening the American dream. The central plot revolves around the tragedy of "Roxy," a mulatto slave whose attempt to save her son from his fate succeeds only in destroying him. An astringent work which raises the serious issue of racial difference, <em>Pudd'nhead Wilson</em> is considered by the critic F.R. Leavis to be "a classic of the use of popular modes--the sensational and the melodramatic." The volume also includes two other late works by Twain, <em>Those Extraordinary Twins</em> and <em>The Man that Corrupted Hadleyburg</em>.</p><p>Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), better known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an American humorist, novelist, writer, and lecturer.

In these 44 stories, Powell grabs you and lets you go at the same time with poignant observations and expressions of longing followed by a quick comment on how banal it all is.

Kevin Wilson, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>The Family Fang</i><br><br>"<i>Cries for Help, Various</i> is ecstatic and necessary.

Scott Blackwood, author of <i>See How Small</i><br><br><b>Praise for Padgett Powell:</b><br><i>Edisto</i> (1984):<br><br> <i>Edisto</i> is a startling book, full of new sights, sounds, and ways of feeling. Mr. Powell weaves wonderful tapestries from ordinary speech; his people, black and white, whether speaking to each other or past each other, tell us things that we never heard before. The book is subtle, daring, and brilliant.&#x201d; Donald Barthelme<br> <br> <i>Edisto</i> is a truly remarkable first novel, both as a narrative and in its extraordinary use of language. It reminds one of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, but it&#x2019;s better sharper, funnier, more poignant.&#x201d; Walker Percy<br><br> <i>Edisto</i> is distinctly a tour de force Some turn of phrase, some flash of humor, some freshly observed detail, some accurately rendered perception of a child&#x2019;s pain or a child&#x2019;s amazement transfigures nearly ever page.&#x201d; Robert Towers, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br><i>A Woman Named Drown</i> (1987):<br><br> Potent, funny, one-of-a-kind It presents one of the sterling comic heroines in recent American fiction Don&#x2019;t miss her.&#x201d; T. Coraghessan Boyle, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> When asked for a list of the best American writers of the younger generation I invariably put the name Padgett Powell at the top.&#x201d; Saul Bellow<br><br><i>Typical</i> (1991):<br><br> This new collection of short stories sends off fireworks of language, language that runs, jumps, and sometimes performs acrobatics in the air.&#x201d; Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times</i><br><br> These twenty-three stories put Powell in a league not only with Barthelme, but also with Stanley Elkin and Barry Hannah.&#x201d; Joseph Coates, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br> Mr. Powell has an almost unequalled ability to bring Southern colloquial speech to the page.&#x201d; Amy Hempel, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br><i>Edisto Revisited</i> (1996):<br><br> Nobody else talks to you like this.&#x201d; Pete Dexter, author of <i>Paris Trout</i><br><br> With his wit, his almost disorientingly dazzling turns of phrase and his utter disdain for middlebrow political correctness, Mr. Powell is like a fabulous guest at a dinner party, the guy who gets people drinking far too much and licking their dessert plates and laughing at jokes for which not a few of them will hate themselves in the morning.&#x201d; Scott Spencer, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br><i>Aliens of Affection</i> (1998):<br><br> Powell&#x2019;s stories are...gleefully non-narrative, aggressively stylized, linguistically inventive, and often very funny.&#x201d; James Hynes, <i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br> Padgett Powell is that rare literary writer, a language-drunk craftsman who&#x2019;s funny.&#x201d; Meg Harlan, <i>Boston Phoenix</i><br><br><i>Mrs. Hollingsworth&#x2019;s Men </i>(2000):<br><br> A slim, sly deceiver of a book, full of mirth and wickedness...excitements and dubious desires .Mrs. Hollingsworth is an adorable character...who makes up the characters of an extraordinary and finally memorable vision.&#x201d; Robert Kelly, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> A hilarious series of comic, linguistically charged rants on anything and anyone who happens to enter Mrs. Hollingsworth&#x2019;s wide-sweeping and unforgiving consciousness.&#x201d; Ken Foster, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> A tour de force of wordplay and lucid description.&#x201d; <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br> The enduring charms of this exhilarating book [are] Mrs. Hollingsworth herself and Powell&#x2019;s exquisite prose.&#x201d; Scott Morris, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br> Many of us have wished that someone would bury the Confederate dead. Powell has gone further given them, and us, a new lease on intelligent life. Mrs. Hollingsworth&#x2019;s Men is refreshing and provocative and very funny.&#x201d; Roy Blount Jr.<br><br> Padgett Powell is among the top five writers of fiction in the country, word-perfect and often, when compelled, full of soaring found lyricism. Mrs. Hollingsworth&#x2019;s Men is very different for Powell, but alight with hard and deep thoughts, true, as usual.&#x201d; Barry Hannah<br><br><i>The Interrogative Mood</i> (2009):<br><br>A 'Best Books of the Year' selection by Amazon.com, <i>The Believer, GQ, Portland Oregonian, Time Out New York, Village Voice</i><br><br> If Duchamp or maybe Magritte wrote a novel (and maybe they did; did they?) it might look something like this remarkable little book of Padgett Powell&#x2019;s: immensely readable, ingenious, witty, and ultimately important-feeling in a way you can&#x2019;t quite describe but don&#x2019;t need to.&#x201d; Richard Ford<br><br> Can you picture the rabble-rousing literary offspring of Flannery O&#x2019;Connor and Donald Barthelme? Does the prospect of reading a flawlessly lyrical, comic novel composed entirely in the interrogative mood pique your curiosity?&#x201d; Elissa Schappell, <i>Vanity Fair</i><br><br> A supreme literary stunt: a short novel&#x2019; composed only of questions, each of which seem to implicate the reader in a narrative conspiracy as serious and absurd as his or her own life.&#x201d; Jonathan Lethem, <i>The Millions</i><br><br> Offhanded, witty, original, and an altogether unique book Powell is a member of the badass gang of Barry Hannah. <i>The Interrogative Mood</i>, serious and laughable, extends this legacy.&#x201d; Rick Moody, <i>Bookforum</i><br><br> This book will sear the unlucky volumes sleeved on either side of it. How it doesn&#x2019;t, itself, combust in flames is a mystery to me. Padgett Powell has given us a wake-up call.&#x201d; Jonathan Safran Foer<br><br> A delightful stylistic flight, and as engrossing as staying up late at summer camp considering every goofy or brilliant question that comes into your head. Padgett Powell is one of the best writers in America, and one of the funniest, too.&#x201d; Ian Frazier<br><br> Another brilliant work of fiction, in some ways Powell&#x2019;s best, by one of the few truly important American writers of our time.&#x201d; Sam Lipsyte<br><br> <i>The Interrogative Mood</i> represents superior value in a crumbling economy. Its 176 pages do not tell a story they tell thousands of stories, all of them starring you.&#x201d; Luc Sante<br><br><i>You &amp; Me </i>(2012):<br><br>Winner of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction,<br><br>Indie Next Pick<br><br> [Powell&#x2019;s] characters might be all talk and no walk, but what wonderful talk it is Powell, in his recent work, has set his mind ablaze. And nothing but exquisite and deeply strange language is left to emerge from the ashes. Michael Miller, National Public Radio<br><br> Padgett Powell&#x2019;s <i>You &amp; Me</i>, mixed with 750 ml of fine bourbon, is the most fun you can have in many states without getting arrested. Braver, tougher, smarter than most of the fiction supposedly pushing the envelope. Why? Because it actually means something.&#x201d; Gary Shteyngart</p><h2>Cases and Materials on Employment Discrimination (Aspen Casebook)</h2><p><p>The ninth edition of the best-selling <em>Cases and Materials on Employment Discrimination</em> blends cases, notes, and problems into an integrated pedagogy that balances scholarly and practice perspectives.

Appalled that his teachings were turned to violent ends, Gandhi called off his Noncooperation Movement and fasted to bring the people back to nonviolence. In the meantime, the British government denied that the riot reflected Indian resistance to its rule and tried the rioters as common criminals. These events have taken on great symbolic importance among Indians, both in the immediate region and nationally. Amin examines the event itself, but also, more significantly, he explores the ways it has been remembered, interpreted, and used as a metaphor for the Indian struggle for independence.<br><br>The author, who was born fifteen miles from Chauri Chaura, brings to his study an empathetic knowledge of the region and a keen ear for the nuances of the culture and language of its people. In an ingenious negotiation between written and oral evidence, he combines brilliant archival work in the judicial records of the period with field interviews with local informants.<br><br>In telling this intricate story of local memory and the making of official histories, Amin probes the silences and ambivalences that contribute to a nation's narrative. He extends his boundaries well beyond Chauri Chaura itself to explore the complex relationship between peasant politics and nationalist discourse and the interplay between memory and history.</p><p><b>Shahid Amin</b> is Professor of History at Delhi University.

Zeno's account is an alternative reality, a series of elliptical episodes dealing with the death of his father, his career, his marriage and affairs, and, above all, his passion for smoking and his spectacular failure to resist the promise of that last cigarette. A hymn to self-delusion and procrastination, Svevo's devilishly funny portrayal of a man's attempt to give up smoking and make sense of his life has become a cult classic.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Art and Architecture of Ancient America, Third Edition: The Mexican, Maya and Andean Peoples (The Yale University Press Pelican History of Art Series)</h2><p>Offers a survey of the paintings and architecture of the Mexican, Mayan, and Andean peoples</p><p></p><h2>Living with a Dead Language: My Romance with Latin</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A delightful mix of grammar and growth, words and wonder.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>An entertaining exploration of the richness and relevance of the Latin language and literature, and an inspiring account of finding renewed purpose through learning something new and challenging<br> </b><br>After thirty-five years as a book editor in New York City, Ann Patty stopped working and moved to the country. Bored, aimless, and lost in the woods, she hoped to challenge her restless, word-loving brain by beginning a serious study of Latin at local colleges.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> As she begins to make sense of Latin grammar and syntax, her studies open unexpected windows into her own life. The louche poetry of Catullus calls up her early days in 1970s New York, Lucretius elucidates her intractable drivenness and her attraction to Buddhism, while Ovid&#x2019;s verse conjures a delightful dimension to the flora and fauna that surround her. Women in Roman history, and an ancient tomb inscription give her new understanding and empathy for her tragic, long deceased mother.&nbsp; Finally, Virgil reconciles her to her new life&#x2014;no longer an urban exile, but a rustic scholar, writer and teacher.&nbsp; Along the way, she meets an impassioned cast of characters: professors, students and classicists outside of academia who keep Latin very much alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Written with humor, heart, and an infectious enthusiasm for words, Patty&#x2019;s book is an object lesson in how learning and literature can transform the past and lead to an unexpected future.</p><p><b>Ann Patty </b>worked in New York trade publishing for more than thirty years.

Patty and her book are both full of life, epitomizing the Latin phrase <i>ad astra per aspera</i> &#x2014; to the stars through difficulties. Those readers who never encountered Latin may overlook this book, but to use the Roman poet Horace&#x2019;s phrase, consider letting <i>carpe diem</i> be your catchphrase, or even<i> carpe noctem</i>: seize the day or seize the night and read this book.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;<b><i>The Washington Post<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;A kind of&nbsp;<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;Caecilius <i>in horto est</i>&nbsp;set.&nbsp; Studying Latin for fun in later life is a niche fantasy, but the &nbsp;impulse to do something substantial is a more widely shared experience.&nbsp; So is the desire to repair some deficit of one's youth . . .

The word "phylogeography" was coined in 1987, and since then the scientific literature has reflected an exploding interest in the topic. Yet, to date, no book-length treatment of this emerging field has appeared. <i>Phylogeography: The History and Formation of Species</i> fills that gap.</p><p>The study of phylogeography grew out of the observation that mitochondrial DNA lineages in natural populations often display distinct geographic orientations. In recent years, the field has expanded to include assessments of nuclear as well as cytoplasmic genomes and the relationships among gene trees, population demography, and organismal history, often formalized as coalescent theory. Phylogeography has connections to molecular evolutionary genetics, natural history, population biology, paleontology, historical geography, and speciation analysis.</p><p><i>Phylogeography</i> captures the conceptual and empirical richness of the field, and also the sense of genuine innovation that phylogeographic perspectives have brought to evolutionary studies.</p><p>This book will be essential reading for graduate students and professionals in evolutionary biology and ecology as well as for anyone interested in the emergence of this new and integrative discipline.</p></p><p>John C. Avise is Professor of Genetics at the University of Georgia and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1994 he served as President of the Society for the Study of Evolution.Avise founded the study of phylogeography, and the field has become an extremely active area in evolutionary biology. While most of the studies are of species of animals, there is a substantial number on humans, and some on plants. I doubt that anyone could have created a book on phylogeography that would be as authoritative and insightful. Avise not only compiles the literature for the reader, he summarizes many of the best studies, and then directs future studies by indicating where the field is shallow, and where the field needs to go. His writing style is easy to read, direct and clear. This is a fine book. (Jeffry B. Mitton <i>The University of Colorado at Boulder</i>)<br><br><i>Phylogeography</i> is an enjoyable and gap-filling synopsis that introduces an actively developing research area. Given its alleged integrative function, [this] book is clearly set apart from other current treatments on population genetics and phylogenetic biology...For graduate students and professionals, [this book is] a very amenable read and a valuable reference source for further inquiry. (Hans Peter Comes <i>Plant Systematics and Evolution</i>)<br><br><i>Phylogeography</i> is a wonderful work and will be a benchmark contribution. The writing style is simple and direct, the content fabulous and the perspective illuminating. It will be a valuable resource for graduate students and other professionals in the field of population genetics, but it should interest all biologists. (Stephen Palumbi <i>Harvard University</i>)<br><br>Phylogeography is a growth area of evolutionary biology. John Avise coined the term 'phylogeography' in 1987 and has been the prime mover in promoting the successful development of the field ever since. It is therefore to be welcomed that he has written this book which reviews the history of phylogeography, the fundamental principles of the field and the current and future value of phylogeography within biogeography and evolutionary biology...I was very impressed by the manner in which Avise communicates the fundamentals of phylogeographic theory. He introduces much of this theory early on but elegantly extends concepts as necessary later in the book. He is exceptionally clear in discussing coalescence, lineage sorting, gene trees. species trees, differing consequences of nuclear vs. mitochondrialmaekers, etc...A very good book...It deserves considerable success.

It will help statesmen, scholars, and citizens to evaluate crucial foreign policy choices.</p></p><p><p>"This book is one of the three or four most significant new contributions to either foreign policy analysis or international political economy that 1 have read in the last decade. It is one of those works that bring a fresh perspective to a subject that has been analyzed at length, and it suggests strongly that the most prominent authors on the subject have made major errors in drawing inferences. Baldwin is simply brilliant at logical construction and reconstruction. The book will be a stimulus and model to anyone who aspires to logical clarity, on any subject."<b>--John S. Odell, University of Southern California</b></p>"This is a study of economics as an instrument of politics, and quite a rigorous one . . . Baldwin tears apart the reasoning of most other scholars and torpedoes not only the conventional wisdom about various cases but just about all generalizations. . . . This is a stimulating book."

The author supplies the basic physical principles necessary for developing a sound intuitive and quantitative sense of the way in which water moves through the land. He outlines the assumptions behind each conceptual approach but also identifies some of the limitations of each. Rich in substance and written to fulfill the needs of future researchers and experts in the field, Dingman treats hydrology as a distinct geoscience that is continually expanding to deal with large-scale changes in land use and climate. The text is organized around four principal themes: the basic concepts underlying the science of hydrology; the global climate, the global hydrologic cycle, and the relation of hydrology to soils and vegetation; the land phase of the hydrologic cycle; and water-resource-management principles and the ways in which hydrologic analysis is applied in that context. Coverage includes approaches for determining regional evapotranspiration rates, the movement of ground water in rock fractures, and the relation of hydrologic regimes to past and future climates. It offers in-depth discussions of hydrologic modeling--model use, modeling terminology, and the process of model development; water-resource-management goals and processes; water supply and demand; water-quality issues; floods and flood-frequency analysis; and drought and low-flow analysis. Outstanding features that facilitate learning include: A tabulation of documented trends in global change of climatic and hydrologic quantities; information on methods for handling missing data; discussions of the BROOK90 model and how it can be used with the text; Internet links to hydrologic information; exercises designed for student exploration; and Excel spreadsheets on the accompanying CD.</p><p>Titles of related interest also from Waveland Press: Chapra, Surface Water-Quality Modeling (ISBN 9781577666059); Fetter, Contaminant Hydrogeology, Second Edition (ISBN 9781577665830) and Gupta, Hydrology and Hydraulic Systems, Third Edition (ISBN 9781577664550).<p> The goal of the first edition of <i>Physical Hydrology</i> was to provide a comprehensive text for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students that treats hydrology as a distinct geoscience. It attempted to develop an understanding of the conceptual basis of hydrology and an introduction to the quantitative relations that implement that understanding in answering scientific and water-resources-management questions. The text seemed to fulfill a need, and I have been pleased with its reception by my colleagues and students. </p> <p> My primary goals in revising <i>Physical Hydrology</i> have been to incorporate significant advances in the rapidly developing field of hydrologic science, to provide a more explicit connection of that science to hydrologic modeling, and to make more complete and useful the treatment of the relation between scientific hydrology and water-resources management. The major changes that have resulted are the following: </p> <ul> <li>Chapter 2 (Basic Hydrologic Concepts) now concludes with an introduction to hydrologic modeling, including discussions of model use, modeling terminology, and the process of model development. It also introduces the BROOK90 model, a physically based, lumped-parameter model that can be readily accessed on the World-Wide Web for student use. Discussions of the ways in which BROOK90 incorporates the physical relations discussed in the text are included as boxes in many of the subsequent chapters.</li> <li>Chapter 3 (Global Climate, Hydrologic Cycle, Soils, and Vegetation) now includes a tabulation of documented trends in global change of climatic and hydrologic quantities.</li> <li>In Chapter 4 (Precipitation), I have added a more extensive discussion of precipitation recycling and a new section on methods for handling missing data&#x2014;an almost universal problem in hydrologic analysis. Also, the discussion of methods for estimating areal precipitation has been streamlined somewhat (one of the few places in which I was able to cut!).</li> <li>In Chapter 5 (Snow and Snowmelt), I have updated the discussion of ways of estimating energy-balance components and added a discussion of hybrid snowmelt models that combine energy-balance and temperature-index approaches.</li> <li>Chapter 6 (Water in Soils) now introduces the concepts of soil-moisture diffusivity and sorptivity, adds a discussion of equilibrium soil-moisture profiles, and expands the discussion of moisture redistribution.</li> <li>Chapter 7 (Evapotranspiration) now contains a brief discussion of soil evaporation as well as updates of the treatments of lake evaporation and energy-budget estimation.</li> <li>In Chapter 8 (Ground Water), the discussion of ground&#x2014;water-surface-water relations has been expanded to include hyporheic flow and the Dupuit approximation for unconfined aquifers draining to streams.</li> <li>Chapter 9 (Stream Response to Water Input) has been reorganized so that the discussion of the mechanisms of stream response to water-input events now precedes the sections on rainfall-runoff modeling. The treatments of both mechanisms and modeling have been substantially revised and updated, and much of the detailed discussion of open-channel flow has been moved to Appendix B.</li> <li>Chapter 10 (Hydrology and Water Resources) has been entirely rewritten and expanded. It now includes a more complete and modern treatment of water-resource management goals and processes; a more detailed discussion of water supply and demand, including the concept of "safe yield" in various ground-water and surface-water settings and an expanded discussion of the estimation and application of flow-duration curves; a more complete discussion of water-quality issues; an expanded section on floods, including flood-frequency analysis; a completely new section on drought and low-flow analysis; and a concluding section on current and projected United States and global water use.</li> <li>Appendix A (Hydrologic Quantities) has been reorganized and largely rewritten to provide a more logical presentation of dimensions, units, and significant figures.</li> <li>Appendix B (Water as a Substance) now contains the detailed treatment of open-channel flow that was formerly in Chapter 9.</li> <li>Appendix C (Statistics) now includes discussions of approaches to fitting probability distributions to data and estimating parameters of distributions, which incorporate the application of L-moments, and a section on statistical criteria for calibrating and validating models.</li> <li>In Appendix D (Water and Energy in the Atmosphere), the treatment of turbulent transfer has been substantially revised.</li> <li>In Appendix F (Stream Gaging), the section on slope-area estimation of discharge has been completely revised.</li> <li>Appendix G is new. It contains links to hydrologic information on the World-Wide Web and is found on the CD accompanying the text.</li> </ul> <p> In keeping with my goal of treating hydrology as a science and of providing an entree to the literature of the field, this edition continues the practice of supporting its discussion with extensive reference citations, in the style of a journal article rather than that of most textbooks. In the revision, over 200 reference citations have been added, and they now total over 800. </p> <p> In carrying out the primary goals of the revision, I also saw opportunities to improve several other aspects of the text: </p> <ul> <li>Cross referencing is facilitated by use of a decimal numbering system for headings.</li> <li>Many of the exercises have been revised so that they provide more opportunity for student exploration of topics rather than simple "plug-and-chug" work.</li> <li>The spreadsheets on the CD that accompanies the book are now in EXCEL, and their formats have been improved and regularized. More modern units are used (kPa instead of mb; J and W instead of cal).</li> <li>The notation, especially for statistical quantities, is generally more conventional (and, I hope, less cumbersome).</li> <li>The "." symbol for multiplication is used throughout; this allows the use of multi-letter symbols without ambiguity.</li> </ul></p><h2>The Price of Salt</h2><p>2016 Reprint of 1952 Edition. &#34;The Price of Salt&#34; is Highsmith&#39;s only lesbian novel. She is best known for her Ripley detective novels. It is a fairly realistic look at lesbian life in the 1950s. Originally published under the pseudonym of Claire Morgan to protect Highsmith&#39;s identity, this novel tells the story of two women and a decision that each one had to make. &#34;For Therese happiness meant risking her future, for Carol it meant sacrificing her past, and for neither could the happiness, if chosen, be assured, for it lay outside of convention, scorned by society, condemned by law.&#34;---From the cover flap. Unlike other lesbian novels of the time, this struck a positive note for the relationship, making it a political statement of sorts, and an enduring classic for this genre.</p><p><p>A chance encounter between two lonely women leads to a passionate romance in this lesbian cult classic. Therese, a struggling young sales clerk, and Carol, a homemaker in the midst of a bitter divorce, abandon their oppressive daily routines for the freedom of the open road, where their love can blossom. But their newly discovered bliss is shattered when Carol is forced to choose between her child and her lover.<br>Author Patricia Highsmith is best known for her psychological thrillers <i>Strangers on a Train</i> and <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley.</i> Originally published in 1952 under a pseudonym, <i>The Price of Salt</i> was heralded as "the novel of a love society forbids." Highsmith's sensitive treatment of fully realized characters who defy stereotypes about homosexuality marks a departure from previous lesbian pulp fiction. Erotic, eloquent, and suspenseful, this story offers an honest look at the necessity of being true to one's nature.<br>Dover (2015) republication of the edition originally published by Bantam Books, New York, 1953.<br>See every Dover book in print at<br><b>www.doverpublications.com</b></p><p></p>Patricia Highsmith (1921&#x2013;1995) was the author of more than twenty novels, including Strangers on a Train, The Price of Salt,&nbsp;The Blunderer and The Talented Mr. Ripley, as well as numerous short stories.</p><h2>Pollution Prevention: Fundamentals and Practice</h2><p><i>Pollution Prevention: Fundamentals and Practice</i> provides a thorough foundation in pollution prevention concepts and methods. It fills an important role in the engineering curriculum by giving engineers in all disciplines the tools to incorporate environmental consequences in decision making in the same way that economic and safety factors are considered. The wealth of background information included makes this an ideal choice for those new to the field as well as for environmental engineering or chemical engineering majors and practitioners. Starting with an introduction to pollution prevention, the author progresses through a review of pollution and its consequences and describes the regulatory framework under which the industry must operate. Later chapters emphasize the sources of industrial pollution and how these can be minimized, the methodology for conducting life-cycle assessments and developing successful pollution prevention plans, and technological means for minimizing the use of water, energy, and reagents in manufacturing. Materials selection, process and product design, and packaging also are addressed. Throughout the text, fully solved example problems provide abundant opportunities to apply the concepts learned.<p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Cooper-Alley, <i>Air Pollution Control: A Design Approach,</i> Fourth Edition (ISBN 9781577666783) and de Nevers, <i>Air Pollution Control Engineering,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9781478629054).</p></p><p>Titles of related interest also available from Waveland Press: Cooper-Alley, <i>Air Pollution Control,</i> Fourth Edition (ISBN 9781577666783); Cooper et al., <i>Foundations of Environmental Engineering</i> (ISBN 9781577660484); and Gupta, <i>Hydrology and Hydraulic Systems,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9781577664550).</p><h2>System Forensics, Investigation, and Response (Information Systems Security &amp; Assurance) (PAPERBACK BOOK ONLY) (Lab Access Code Sold Separately)</h2><p>Revised and updated to address current issues and technology, System Forensics, Investigation, and Response, Third Edition provides a solid, broad grounding in digital forensics.

There are only 168 hours in a week, and it often feels like we work most of them. In fact, research shows that professionals with smartphones are directly dialed in to work around 72 hours a week, and that's not even counting the hours we spend thinking or worrying about work. It's true that hard work and success go hand in hand, but when does enough become too much?

For the cost of a regular graphite writing pencil and an equally ordinary black colored pencil, you can create drawings worthy of framing and displaying. In this straightforward, aspiring artist's guide to rendering a variety of popular subjects with only two pencils, artist and art instructor Mark Crilley presents a direct, approachable, and achievable method for drawing just about anything.<i> The Two-Pencil Method </i>breaks down Crilley's techniques across six chapters of five lessons each. In each lesson, you'll learn how the two-pencil method can add depth and shading, allowing you to create bold and distinctive drawings that go beyond mere sketchbook doodles. The book moves from a primer on drawing basics to step-by-step examples of still lifes, landscapes, animals, travel sketches, and portraits. With each chapter, Crilley's confident and encouraging voice and expert insights demonstrate how to achieve stunning artistic results from the simplest of art materials.</p><p><b>Mark Crilley</b> was raised in Detroit, Michigan. After graduating from Kalamazoo College, he traveled to Taiwan and Japan, where he taught English for nearly five years. It was during his stay in Japan that he created the Eisner Award&#x2013;nominated comic&nbsp;<i>Akiko on the Planet Smoo</i>, which spawned a series of graphic novels and prose novel adaptations.In 1998, Mark Crilley was named to&nbsp;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>&#x2019;s It List of the 100 most creative people in entertainment.INTRODUCTION <br><br>My Two-Pencil Method is exactly what it sounds like: an approach to drawing that relies on just two different types of pencils&#x2014;an ordinary graphite pencil and a black colored pencil. The graphite pencil allows you to get a drawing started and to fine-tune shading. The black colored pencil allows you to dramatically heighten the contrast. Using these two humble drawing tools, you can create pictures as beautiful as any you&#x2019;ve ever seen. That&#x2019;s not a grand promise. It&#x2019;s a simple truth.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#x2019;m going to bet that you&#x2019;ve already got a serviceable writing pencil nearby. That means the black colored&nbsp; pencil may be the only pencil that you need to go out and acquire. As of this writing, that pencil shouldn&#x2019;t cost you much more than a dollar. Let&#x2019;s say $1.39. There you have it&#x2014;Mark Crilley&#x2019;s idea of what the barrier to entry ought to be for an aspiring artist.<br><br>In the lessons ahead, you&#x2019;ll see how I use the Two-Pencil Method to complete a wide variety of drawing projects. I&#x2019;ll start with simple projects designed for the absolute novice, then move toward subjects that are a little more ambitious: landscapes, travel sketches, portraits, and the like. I&#x2019;ll show you what and how each pencil contributes to each drawing, and take special care to indicate when you should bring in the black colored pencil to work its magic. If you are patient and complete every lesson in the book, I have no doubt you can master this approach and make it your own.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll need some moxie and determination, for sure. Those, sadly, can&#x2019;t be bought. But I&#x2019;m sure that you have a little of both already.<br><br>Even the people who adore their art supplies can agree with me on at least one point: those fancy materials won&#x2019;t do you a lot of good if they&#x2019;re collecting dust in a drawer. Whether my Two-Pencil Method becomes your technique of choice or not, promise me that you&#x2019;ll draw. Keep at it. Draw every day if you can. Draw like crazy. If you draw, and draw, and draw, until your two pencils have been worn down to two little stumps, you will make progress. You will hone your skills. And one day, you will become the artist you were always meant to be.<br> And that is something you won&#x2019;t want to trade for all the money in the world.<br><br>***</p><h2>Precalculus with Trigonometry: Concepts and Applications - Student Edition (includes online access)</h2><p>AMAZING condition.

When the English and Dutch empires both tried to claim the same patch of coast between the Hudson River and Cape Cod, the sea itself became the arena of contact and conflict. During the violent European invasions, the region&#x2019;s Algonquian-speaking Natives were navigators, boatbuilders, fishermen, pirates, and merchants who became active players in the emergence of the Atlantic World. Drawing from a wide range of English, Dutch, and archeological sources, Lipman uncovers a new geography of Native America that incorporates seawater as well as soil. Looking past Europeans&#x2019; arbitrary land boundaries, he reveals unseen links between local episodes and global events on distant shores.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lipman&#x2019;s book &#x201c;successfully redirects the way we look at a familiar history&#x201d; (Neal Salisbury, Smith College).

Who were these people and where did they come from? Why, and equally intriguingly, how did they erect the giant stone statues found all over the island? <br> Paul Bahn and John Flenley tackle these and a host of other questions, introducing us, along the way, to the bizarre birdman cult found in the island's art, and the only recently deciphered Rongorongo script engraved on wooden panels. <em>The Enigmas of Easter Island</em> combines a wealth of new archaeological evidence, intriguing folk memories and the records of Captain Cook and other early explorers, to reveal how the island's decline may stem from ecological catastrophe. The result is a fascinating portrait of a civilization that still retains many of its mysteries. This book provides a wealth of new material, including much information only recently discovered and not available in any other book for general readers. <br> One of the most mysterious places on the planet, Easter Island has been an object of intense fascination since rediscovered by European explorers. Attractively illustrated with numerous photographs throughout the book, <em>The Enigmas of Easter Island</em> is the finest volume ever written on this inscrutable and tantalizing isle, the latest word on one of the world's great conundrums.</p><p><br><strong>Paul Bahn</strong> is one of the leading writers and broadcasters on archaeology for a popular audience. He is the author of the standard introduction to cave art, <em>Images of the Ice Age, The Bluffer's Guide to Archaeology</em>, and the popular <em>Archaeology: A Very Short Introduction</em>. <strong>John Flenley</strong> is currently Professor of Geography at Massey University in New Zealand. A world authority on the ecology of tropical rainforests, he was the first to publish evidence that Easter Island was once forested.<br>Theorists have invoked everything from restless spirits to extraterrestrials and anti-gravity to explain Easter Island's giant stone statues. The reality, according to this comprehensive reconstruction of the island's history, now in its second edition, is more prosaic. The megaliths were carved by humans from the island's soft volcanic stone to commemorate prestigious ancestors, express clan pride and demarcate "a sacred border...between 'home' and 'out there'"-and because on Easter Island there "was little else to do" but carve stone. In addition to the mechanics of sculpting, dragging and erecting the idols, Bahn (Written in Bones; The Cambridge Illustrated History of Archaeology; etc.) and ecologist Flenley cover other aspects of the island's vanished culture, from the remarkable seafaring skills of the Polynesians who settled the island to the prevalence of phallic, vulval and birdman motifs in the islanders' eccentric artistic stylings. Above all, they see Easter Island's saga as a cautionary tale of mankind's "eco-stupidity." As the Polynesians and the rats they brought with them decimated the once verdant forests, the island withered into a treeless desert stalked by famine, violence and possibly cannibalism-a microcosm illustrating the consequences of resource depletion for an all too finite Earth. The authors develop an occasionally cumbersome scholarly apparatus as they delve into the minutiae of archaeology, linguistics, sediment cores and pollen analysis and fence with academic rivals, especially with Kon-Tiki voyager Thor Heyerdahl, whose theory of settlement from South America receives a lengthy, scathing rebuttal. But in dispelling the mythology of Easter Island, they show us a society that is all the more interesting for being recognizably human. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>First Class: The Legacy of Dunbar, America s First Black Public High School</h2><p><p><b>Dunbar High School in Washington, DC, defied the odds and, in the process, changed America.</b> In the first half of the twentieth century, Dunbar was an academically elite public school, despite being racially segregated by law and existing at the mercy of racist congressmen who held the school&#x2019;s purse strings. These enormous challenges did not stop the local community from rallying for the cause of educating its children.</p><p>Dunbar attracted an extraordinary faculty: one early principal was the first black graduate of Harvard, almost all the teachers had graduate degrees, and several earned PhDs&#x2014;all extraordinary achievements given the Jim Crow laws of the times. Over the school&#x2019;s first eighty years, these teachers developed generations of highly educated, high-achieving African Americans, groundbreakers that included the first black member of a presidential cabinet, the first black graduate of the US Naval Academy, the first black army general, the creator of the modern blood bank, the first black state attorney general, the legal mastermind behind school desegregation, and hundreds of educators.</p><p>By the 1950s, Dunbar High School was sending 80 percent of its students to college. Today, as with too many troubled urban public schools, the majority of Dunbar students struggle with reading and math. Journalist and author Alison Stewart, whose parents were both Dunbar graduates, tells the story of the school&#x2019;s rise, fall, and path toward resurgence as it looks to reopen its new, state-of-the-art campus in the fall of 2013.</p></p><p><p><b>Alison Stewart</b> is an award-winning journalist whose twenty-year career includes anchoring and reporting for NPR, NBC News, ABC News, and CBS News.

It begins with <em>Agamemnon</em>, which describes Agamemnon's return from the Trojan War and his murder at the hands of his wife Clytemnestra, continues with her murder by their son Orestes in <em>Libation Bearers</em>, and concludes with Orestes' acquittal at a court founded by Athena in <em>Eumenides</em>. The trilogy thus traces the evolution of justice in human society from blood vengeance to the rule of law, Aeschylus' contribution to a Greek legend steeped in murder, adultery, human sacrifice, cannibalism, and endless intrigue. This new translation is faithful to the strangeness of the original Greek and to its enduring human truth, expressed in language remarkable for poetic intensity, rich metaphorical texture, and a verbal density that modulates at times into powerful simplicity. The translation's precise but complicated rhythms honor the music of the Greek, bringing into unforgettable English the Aeschylean vision of a world fraught with spiritual and political tensions.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alan Shapiro</strong> is Professor of English and Creative Writing at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

However, soon Debussy&#39;s music became more experimental and individualistic, as is clear in his first mature work Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun. Debussy quickly moved away from traditional techniques and produced the pictures in sound that led his work to be described as &#34;musical Impressionism.&#34; This new biography--the first in English in 30 years--offers new insights into the life of this enigmatic composer, revealing a figure more seminal and revolutionary than previously thought.</p><p>&#39;That great blue Sphinx&#39;, Debussy called the sea. Debussy himself was something of a Sphinx: in the early 1890s he was thinking of &#39;founding a society for musical esotericism&#39;, and although, on the surface, most of his music is instantly engaging and accessible, at a deeper level run currents that are dangerous, unpredictable, destructive. In this new biography, Roger Nichols considers the life and music of this seminal figure charting the currents and the whirlpools in which other humans were sometimes unlucky enough to get caught. Debussy&#39;s status is such that no modern composer has been able to ignore him, asking, as he does, any number of riddles to which late twentieth-century music is still searching answers.'A short but searching new biography of Debussy by Roger Nichols is one of an admirable CUP series 'Musical Lives', authoritative texts aimed at a broader intelligent readership. That Nichols's far from superficial study is most stylishly written and approachable goes without saying, and indeed its very concision brings significant aspects of Debussy's life and work into sharper focus.' Musical Times<br><br>'Roger Nichols has absorbed this greatly expanded range of information and by skilful selection compressed it into less than 170 pages of text.' The Times Literary Supplement<br><br>'The volume is written with a cool delicacy and precision apt to its subject.'

Supported by conceptual formulations and research evidence, this text helps clinical and counseling psychologists deepen their understanding of the Rorschach and sharpen their skill in administering it. The Second Edition includes new material on the issue of projection, revised normative data on young people age 5 to 16, and a demonstration of the recently developed Comprehensive System "search strategy" for interpreting children's and adolescents' records. New to this edition also are sections on interpreting the Schizophrenia Index (SCZI), the Depression Index (DEPI), the Coping Deficit Index (CDI), and the Hypervigilence Index (HVI), and a discussion of bipolar disorder and the dynamic interplay of mania and depression. Subsequent chapters present new formulations of faltering personality development and antisocial behavior and new information on the assessment of learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A final chapter offers new material on Rorschach-based recommendations in child custody disputes. Throughout the text, explanatory concepts and empirical data are used to link features of normal and abnormal development with response patterns on the Rorschach, which are then linked to concrete criteria for diagnosis and treatment planning. The authors provide fourteen case studies to demonstrate clearly the application of these principles in clinical practice. Based on a system that has, over time, demonstrated both its validity and reliability, this book is an essential resource for all psychologists practicing, teaching, supervising, or researching personality assessment of children and adolescents.</p><p><p><b>John E.

As it became clear that a fight was inevitable, the French and English ships drew into battle formation. Aboard his flagship <em>Victory</em>, Nelson offered his famous laconic signal to his seamen--"England expects that every man will do his duty"--and gave the order to fire. After over six hours of bloody exchanges the British had achieved an overwhelming victory, Nelson--his fame assured for the ages--lay dead from a sniper's bullet, and Napoleon's dreams of an invasion of England were forever dashed.<br> Because of its dramatic nature--the one-sidedness of the British victory, Nelson's death at the very moment of triumph--Trafalgar has often been viewed as an isolated feat on the part of the great English commander, or at best the result of a naval campaign begun only months earlier. But as Alan Schom shows in his widely-acclaimed book <em>Trafalgar: Countdown to Battle 1803-1805</em>, this apocalyptic showdown was actually the result of a strategy laid out by the British Admiralty two years earlier, when Napoleon issued orders for the creation of what would have become the largest army flotilla ever before assembled. The Emperor's aim was to invade the British Isles with a force of over 167,000 men conveyed aboard nearly 2,400 vessels--his plan was successfully thwarted not because of the tactical genius of Lord Nelson on a single day of battle, but rather because of the brilliant strategy and remarkable perseverance of the hitherto unsung hero Admiral Sir William Cornwallis.<br> Until now the facts surrounding this unprecedented military buildup have been largely ignored or misinterpreted by historians. In fashioning his brilliant and gripping reinterpretation of the events leading to the famous battle, Alan Schom has mined the rich and previously unexplored archives of England and France to place Trafalgar in its true historical scope and context. He shows convincingly how Cornwallis (brother of Lord Cornwallis who surrendered to Washington at Yorktown) conducted a brilliant blockade of the French fleet both at Brest and off Spain, effectively ruining Napoleon's invasion plans. He also demonstrates the importance of Prime Minister William Pitt who mustered a powerful army to defend England's shores, while reinvigorating a run-down and demoralized Royal Navy. And by letting them speak across the years from the journals and memoirs they left behind, Schom brings a rich and varied cast of characters to life--from politicians, admirals, and generals, to the common soldiers and sailors of both sides.<br> This book is far more than just a naval history. It tells the compelling story of the centuries-old French-British rivalry as it appproached its culmination at the dawn of the nineteenth century. Marvelously written, <em>Trafalgar</em> brings a freshness to an episode often recounted but never before fully understood.</p><p><br><strong>Alan Schom</strong> was a professor of French and European history before retiring to write full-time.

Why, for example, can a religious soup kitchen get an exemption from zoning laws in order to expand its facilities to better serve the needy, while a secular soup kitchen with the same goal cannot? Why is a Sikh boy permitted to wear his ceremonial dagger to school while any other boy could be expelled for packing a knife? Why are religious obligations that conflict with the law accorded special toleration while other obligations of conscience are not?</p><p><i>In Why Tolerate Religion?</i>, Brian Leiter argues that the reasons have nothing to do with religion, and that Western democracies are wrong to single out religious liberty for special legal protections. He offers new insights into what makes a claim of conscience distinctively "religious," and draws on a wealth of examples from America, Europe, and elsewhere to highlight the important issues at stake. With philosophical acuity, legal insight, and wry humor, Leiter shows why our reasons for tolerating religion are not specific to religion but apply to all claims of conscience, and why a government committed to liberty of conscience is not required by the principle of toleration to grant exemptions to laws that promote the general welfare.</p></p><p><p>"Think you understand religious toleration? Think again. Brian Leiter's bracing argument moves deftly from the classics of political philosophy to the riddles of modern case law, demolishing old nostrums and sowing fresh insights with each step. Every reader will learn something from this remarkable book, and, beginning now, every serious scholar of religious toleration will have to contend with Leiter's bold claims."<b>--Christopher L. Eisgruber, Princeton University</b></p><p>"This is a provocative and bracing essay, one that is bound to stimulate much discussion."<b>--Richard Kraut, Northwestern University</b></p><p>"The place of religion in the public arena, and the kind of protection and even respect it should be entitled to from the state, is a topic of significant contemporary interest. Leiter writes about it with wit and good humor. He is even bruising on occasion. But there can be no doubting his capacity as a scholar, his intellectual energy, or his ability to persuade."<b>--Timothy Macklem, King's College London</b></p><p>"Leiter argues that there are no principled, moral reasons for singling out religion as the subject of toleration. He has cut through a dense philosophical and legal literature, focused on a question of great importance, and developed a provocative, sharp, and yet nuanced case. Anyone concerned with this topic will have to read and take seriously the arguments presented in this very well-written and accessible book."<b>--Micah J.

Atheist apologists have become increasingly vociferous and confident in their claims: that a morality requiring benevolence towards all and universal human rights need not be grounded in religion; that modern science disproves the existence of God; and that there is nothing innately religious about human beings. <br><br>In <em>Atheist Overreach</em>, Christian Smith takes a look at the evidence and arguments, and explains why we ought to be skeptical of these atheists' claims about morality, science, and human nature. He does not argue that atheism is necessarily wrong, but rather that its advocates are advancing crucial claims that are neither rationally defensible nor realistic. Their committed worldview feeds unhelpful arguments and contributes to the increasing polarization of today's political landscape. Everyone involved in the theism-atheism debates, in shared moral reflection, and in the public consumption of the findings of science should be committed to careful reasoning and rigorous criticism. This book provides readers with the information they need to participate more knowledgably in debates about atheism and what it means for our society.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christian Smith</strong> is William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame. Smith holds an MA (1987) and PhD (1990) in Sociology from Harvard University and has studied at Harvard Divinity School. He has taught at Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Gordon College, MA.<br><br>"Many essays and books have been written in response to the anti-theistic polemics of the so-called New Atheists. Christian Smith's <em>Atheist Overreach</em> is the equal of any of those writers in his acquaintance with the relevant literature and in the acuity of his critique of the claims of the New Atheists. What makes his book stand out from the crowd is that he is writing for the general reader, rather than specialists, that he never overreaches in what he claims to have established, and that -- unlike much of the writing on both sides -- he is never abusive of those whose views he is critiquing. The style is lucid and engaging. In every way, an admirable contribution to the debate." -- Nicholas Wolterstorff, Yale University <br><p></p><br>"Clearly and accessibly written, <em>Atheist Overreach</em> eschews polemics on a topic that usually evokes nothing else. Christian Smith raises questions that every thoughtful atheist must deal with." -- James W. Jones, author of <em>Can Science Explain Religion? The Cognitive Science Debate</em><p></p><br>"This book provides an invaluable resource for believers and nonbelievers to dialogue about important moral questions, presenting a thorough and readable evaluation of the claims of authors who write as a moral voice of atheism in the public square. At a time when we struggle to have civil discussion about challenging issues such as religion, Christian Smith's balanced approach will undoubtedly help launch an important, productive dialogue among atheists, religious believers, and those who are not sure." -- Margarita Mooney, author of <em>Faith Makes Us Live: Surviving and Thriving in the</em> <em>Haitian Diaspora</em><p></p><br>"Incisive... Smith's powerful arguments never collapse into apologetics or defense of theism, but instead offer crucial weak spots for atheists to consider. These thoughtful essays and their refreshingly balanced approach will appeal to a general audience searching for clarity and precision in considering the shortcomings of atheist debates." <br>--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"<em>Atheist Overreach: What Atheism Can't Deliver</em> by Christian Smith is a well-balanced collection of essays seeking to point out certain weak spots in some of the less modest atheist claims with respect to ethics, the relation between science and religion, and finally, the question of whether humans are naturally religious."--<em>Religion Watch</em><p></p><br>"I highly recommend you read this book. It'll sharpen your thinking and equip you to help others dissect common atheist claims. Importantly, its tone isn't that of a gleeful take-down, but rather a careful critique of ideas."--<em>The Gospel Coalition</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Microeconomics</h2><p><p> <b>NOTE:&nbsp;</b>This edition features the same content as the traditional text in a convenient, three-hole-punched, loose-leaf version.

In the moments before his death, he dispatches one last pigeon. The bird is carrying his extraordinary gift to the girl he has loved since adolescence. Intertwined with this story is the contemporary tale of Yair Mendelsohn, who has his own legacy from the 1948 war. Yair is a tour guide&nbsp;specializing in bird-watching trips who, in middle age, falls in love again with a childhood girlfriend. His growing passion for her, along with a gift from his mother on her deathbed, becomes the key to a life he thought no longer possible.&nbsp; <br><br>Unforgettable in both its particulars and its sweep, <i>A Pigeon and A Boy</i> is a tale of lovers then and now--of how deeply we love, of what home is, and why we, like pigeons trained to fly in one direction only, must eventually return to it.&nbsp; In a voice that is at once playful, wise, and altogether beguiling, Meir Shalev tells a story as universal as war and as intimate as a winged declaration of love.</p><p>Meir Shalev was born in 1948 on Nahalal, Israel&#x2019;s first moshav, and is one of Israel&#x2019;s most celebrated novelists.

His unexpected Hebrew and the pigeon that had alighted from his mouth surprised all present, even those who could not understand what he was saying.<br><br>"A pigeon? What pigeon?"<br><br>The man&#x2014;stout and suntanned as only Americans can be, with moccasins on his feet and a mane of white hair on his head&#x2014;pointed to the turret of the monastery. Many years had passed, but there were a few things he still remembered about the terrible battle that had taken place here. "And forgetting them," he declared, "is something I'll never be able to do." Not only the fatigue and the horror, not only the victory&#x2014;"A victory that took both sides by surprise," he noted&#x2014;but also the minor details, the ones whose importance becomes apparent only later: for one, the stray bullets--or perhaps they were intentional&#x2014;that struck the bell of the monastery on occasion&#x2014;"Right here, this very bell"&#x2014;and then the bell would ring sharply, an odd sound that sank, then abated, but continued to resound in the darkness for a long while.<br><br>"And the pigeon?"<br><br>"A strange sound. Sharp at first, and high-pitched, like even the bell was surprised; then it got weaker, in pain but not dead, until the next shot hit it. One of our wounded guys said, 'Bells are used to getting hit from the inside, not the outside.'"<br><br>He smiled to himself as though he had only just understood. His teeth were bared, and even those were terribly white, as only elderly American teeth can be.<br><br>"But what about the pigeon? What kind of a pigeon was it?"<br><br>"I'm ninety-nine percent sure it was a homing pigeon, a Palmach carrier pigeon. We'd been fighting all night, and in the morning, two or three hours after sunrise, we saw it suddenly lifting off."<br><br>This Hebrew he had unleashed, without prior warning, was good&#x2014;in spite of his accent&#x2014;but his use of the term homing pigeon in English sounded more pleasant and proper than its Hebrew equivalent, even if the bird in question did belong to the Palmach.<br><br>"How could you be sure?"<br><br>"A pigeon handler was assigned to us, a pigeon expert with a little dovecote&#x2014;that's what it was called&#x2014;on his back. Maybe he managed to dispatch the bird before he was killed, or maybe the dovecote busted and the bird flew away."<br><br>"He was killed? How?"<br><br>"How? There was no lack of how to get killed here&#x2014;all you had to do was choose: by a bullet or shrapnel, in the head or the stomach or that major artery in your thigh. Sometimes it was right away and sometimes it was real slow, a few hours after you got hit."<br><br>His yellow eyes pierced me. "Amazing, isn't it?" he said, chuckling. "We went to battle with homing pigeons, like in ancient Greece."<br><br>2<br><br>And suddenly, above that hell, the fighters saw a pigeon. Born from bulbs of smoke, delivered from shrouds of dust, the pigeon rose, she soared. Above the grunts and the shouts, above the whisper of shrapnel in the chill of the air, above the invisible paths of bullets, above the exploding grenades and the barking rifles and the pounding cannons.<br><br>A plain-looking pigeon: bluish-gray with scarlet legs and two dark stripes like those of a prayer shawl adorning the wings. A pigeon like a thousand others, like any other pigeon. Only an expert's ears could pick up on the power of those beating wings, double that of normal pigeons; only an expert's eyes could discern the width and the depth of the bird's breast, or the beak that carries forth the slant of the forehead in a straight line, or the characteristic light-colored swelling where it meets the head. Only the heart of a pigeon fancier could grasp and contain the longing that has collected inside such a bird and determined its course and forged its strength. But already his eyes had grown dim, his ears had fallen deaf, his heart had emptied and was still. Only she remained&#x2014;the pigeon&#x2014;her yearning for home, his final wish.<br><br>Up. First and foremost, up. Above the blood, above the fire and the columns of smoke. Above the wounded, their flesh riddled, torn, burnt, silent. Above those whose bodies will remain intact but whose souls have been extinguished. Above those who have died and who, with the passing of many days, will die once again with the deaths of those who remembered them.<br><br>Up. Aloft and distant, to where the gunfire will become a faint ticking and the shouts will fall mute and the smell will dissipate and the smoke will clear, and the dead will appear one like the other as if cast from a single mold, and the living will take their leave of them, each man to his destiny, wondering what they did right to deserve to live, and what their comrades&#x2014;lying now before them&#x2014;did wrong that they deserved to die. And then a quick look to the sides, and homeward, in a straight line, as homing pigeons fly. Homeward, her heart fluttering but courageous, golden eyes frightened but fully open, missing no helpful topographical detail, a transparent, auxiliary set of eyelids pulled taut over them against blinding light and dust. Another thin stripe embellishes the short, curved tail, a hint at the bird's ancient Damascene pedigree. The small, rounded head, full of yearning and memories: the loft, the pigeonhole, the cooing of a mate, the warm scent of the nest and brooding. The hand of a young woman passing over the feeding trough, the tinkling of seeds in the young woman's box calls her, the woman's gaze scans the heavens awaiting her, and her words&#x2014;"Come, come, come"&#x2014;invite and comfort.<br><br>"Not only me. We all saw it," the elderly American said. "They must have, too, because all the weapons fell silent for a moment. Ours and theirs. Not a single gun fired, no grenades exploded, and all the mouths stopped shouting. It was so quiet that we heard the bird's wings beating the air. For a single moment every eye and every finger was following that bird as she did what we all wanted to do: make her way home."<br><br>By now he was quite agitated; he paced to and fro, his fingers plunged deep into the snowy-white thickness of his leonine hair. "After all, that's what she was: a homing pigeon. That's all she wants and all she knows. She took off, didn't make that big circle in the air you always read about in books, the one that homing pigeons make before they figure out the right direction to take. She just flew straight out of there, no delay, like an arrow shot in that direction&#x2014;northwest, if I'm not mistaken; yes, according to the time of day and the sun, I'm correct. Right in that direction. You wouldn't believe how fast she disappeared."<br><br>A matter of seconds. With the greatest of longing and speed. She was there, then she faded. The hand that dispatched her fell to the ground; the gaze still followed her, the bell still resounded, refusing to die out, a few final notes spilling forth, gathering toward that distant sea of silence, while the blue-gray of the pigeon was swallowed into its twin on the horizon, and was gone. And below, the fingers returned to their triggers and the eyes to their scopes, and the gun barrels resumed their thunder and the mouths their groaning and gaping and gulping of air, their bellowing, their gasping of last breaths.<br><br>Now the man turned to his friends, reverted to American English, explaining and describing and pointing: "Over there somewhere, behind the pine trees," or "Right here." He told of an Iraqi armored vehicle equipped with a machine gun and a cannon that "was running around here like it owned the place." With the gestures of a generous host he motioned to "right there, that's where I lay with my gun, at the corner of the roof. But over on that building there was a sniper and he put a bullet in me."<br><br>With dexterity uncommon in a man his age, he bent over and rolled up his trousers, exposing two pale scars between his knee and ankle. "See? Right there. The little one's where the bullet went in, and the big one's where it came out. Our sapper carried me down on his back, went back up to take my place, and got hit by a mortar shell." He reverted to Hebrew, meant only for me. "A bigger and stronger guy even than me, poor sucker. Torn right in half, died in a split second."<br><br>He talked and recounted, freeing memories that had been imprisoned inside him for so long. He let them breathe a little air, stretch their bones, see the place where they were formed; he let them argue, compare: Which had changed? Which hadn't even been there in the first place? Which were worthy of being preserved, and which no longer?<br><br>"And the guy who brought the pigeons?" I asked, pursuing my own agenda. "The pigeon handler? You said he was killed. Did you see where exactly?"<br><br>Those eyes settled on me again, the yellow eyes of a lion. One large, tanned hand wrapped itself around my shoulders; another large, tanned hand rose in the air and pointed. Age spots on the back of it, its fingernails buffed, a silver sailor's watch beautifying its wrist, a white shirtsleeve pressed and rolled to the elbow. It was a hand easy to imagine clutching a rifle, patting the head of a grandchild, pounding on a table, knowing waists and thighs.<br><br>"There."<br><br>A good and pleasant vigor coursed through me suddenly, as if those were the eyes of a father gazing upon his son, as if this were the hand of a father slipping from head to shoulder&#x2014;guiding, offering strength and support.<br><br>"Where? Show me exactly."<br><br>He tilted his aged head downward to mine, just as all the tall people in my life do when speaking to short ones. "There.

She has served as director of the child development laboratory center at the University of Cincinnati, serving children and families from a wide range of backgrounds. She also served as department head with responsibility for early childhood associate, bachelor&#39;s, and master&#39;s degree programs. She has been involved in several community early childhood efforts including board membership on the University of Cincinnati Early Learning Center. She is active in 4C, a National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agency, and has participated tirelessly on many of its Agency training committees. She is a recipient of the 4C Early Childhood Award and was the first recipient of the Ohio Association for the Education of Young Children&#39;s Early Childhood Teacher Educator Award. In 2007, 4C again recognized Dr. Sciarra&#39;s work by naming the 4C library in her honor. Dr. Sciarra has mentored many early childhood educators, including coauthor Anne Dorsey. Together they also wrote LEADERS AND SUPERVISORS IN CHILD CARE PROGRAMS (Delmar Cengage Learning). In 2010, Dr. Sciarra and Professor Dorsey were honored with the United Way Impact Award for their work in promoting appropriate early childhood education.</p><h2>Ancient Israel: The Former Prophets: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings: A Translation with Commentary</h2><p><p><strong>Robert Alter&#x2019;s award-winning translation of the Hebrew Bible continues with the stirring narrative of Israel&#x2019;s ancient history.</strong></p> To read the books of the Former Prophets in this riveting Robert Alter translation is to discover an entertaining amalgam of hair-raising action and high literary achievement. Samson, the vigilante superhero of Judges, slaughters thousands of Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. David, the Machiavellian prince of Samuel and Kings, is one of the great literary figures of antiquity. A ruthless monarch, David embodies a life in full dimension as it moves from brilliant youth through vigorous prime to failing old age. <p>Samson and David play emblematic roles in the rise and fall of ancient Israel, a nation beset by internal divisions and external threats. A scattering of contentious desert tribes joined by faith in a special covenant with God, Israel emerges through the bloody massacres of Canaanite populations recounted in Joshua and the anarchic violence of Judges. The resourceful David consolidates national power, but it is power rooted in conspiracy, and David dies bitterly isolated in his court, surrounded by enemies. His successor, Solomon, maintains national unity through his legendary wisdom, wealth, and grand public vision, but after his death Israel succumbs to internal discord and foreign conquest. Near its end, the saga of ancient Israel returns to the supernatural. In Elijah&#x2019;s fiery ascent to heaven many would find the harbinger of a messiah coming to save his people in their time of need.</p> map</p><p>Robert Alter&#39;s translation of the Hebrew Bible, the magnificent capstone to a lifetime of distinguished scholarly work, has won the PEN Center Literary Award for Translation. His immense achievements in scholarship ranging from the eighteenth-century European novel to contemporary Hebrew and American literature earned Alter the Robert Kirsch Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Los Angeles Times. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, Alter is the Class of 1937 Professor of Hebrew and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley.Alter's translation can be fairly described as a godsend...Immediately readable, immensely learned, an education and a restitution. --Seamus Heaney<br><br>The poets will rejoice.

This book traces the issue's roots to the Middle Ages, when English power and control came to extend to the whole of the British Isles. By 1300 it looked as if Edward I was in control of virtually the whole of the British Isles. Ireland, Scotland, and Wales had, in different degrees, been subjugated to his authority; contemporaries were even comparing him to King Arthur. This was the culmination of a remarkable English advance into the outer zones of the British Isles in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The advance was not only a matter of military power, political control, and governmental and legal institutions; it also involved extensive colonization and the absorption of these outer zones into the economic and cultural orbit of an England-dominated world. What remained to be seen was how stable (especially in Scotland and Ireland) this English 'empire' would be; how far the northern and western parts of the British Isles could be absorbed in an English-centered polity and society; and to what extent the early and self-confident development of English identity would determine the relationships between England and the rest of the British Isles. The answers to those questions would be shaped by the past of the country that was England; the answers would also cast their shadow over the future of the British Isles for centuries to come.<br></p><p><br>A former President of the Royal Historical Society, <strong>R.

The new edition features step by step instructions and examples for creating everything from newsletters, product sheets, catalogs, advertisements and forms to newspapers, tabloids and documents used on the Web.</p></p><p>This book is an excellent choice for anyone aspiring to become a successful desktop-publishing professional. In fact, it's <i>the</i> guide, long respected in the desktop-publishing community, and this fourth edition has more examples of good and bad designs than ever. <p> Parker and Berry first discuss essential design concepts such as relevance, proportion, consistency, contrast, restraint, and attention to detail. Next the authors teach you about basic tools for organizing layouts: grids, columns, gutters, headlines, kickers, captions, bullet lists, and pull quotes, to name a few. They delve into the intricacies of typography and font families, highlighting such concepts as type size, alignment, and leading and kerning. Next you learn about the use of white space and about rulers and accents such as borders, boxes, drop shadows, and bleeds. The authors discuss illustrations, clip art, backgrounds, charts, diagrams, tables, and maps and advise you on positioning those elements on a page. There's also a lot of information on selecting, resizing, and placing photographs. A full-color chapter illustrates how to choose color and use spot color, full color, and duotones. </p> <p> At this point the authors move from theory to hands-on projects--you apply the design concepts that they have already put forth. You learn about the appropriate design, graphic, and text elements for newsletters, ads, catalogs, and other business correspondence. Each chapter in this section offers plenty of illustrations and ends with a checklist of reminders that you can refer to as you design.</p> <p> Especially useful are chapter 12, which features common design mistakes along with illustrations and explanations of what's wrong, and chapter 13, which highlights redesigns of poorly produced publications. The latter is a before-and-after glimpse of designs of almost all types of publications, from newsletter to survey. These two chapters drive home succinctly and with great visual impact every point of design that the authors have previously discussed. Finally, the appendix offers extra tips on printing in color, and choosing image databases, paper, and service bureaus.</p> <p> The authors don't refer to the Windows or Macintosh operating systems or to any software programs. The understanding is that you will learn how to use your software tools elsewhere and consult the book for elements of design. That's a reasonable goal, as the authors maintain a clear, concise tone and offer many tips that are tangential but still relevant to the subject matter. For example, the chapter on type has a short sidebar on the difference between kerning and tracking and a longer sidebar on font substitution. All in all, this book functions well as both a how-to manual for beginning designers and as a design reference for more advanced designers. <i>--Kathleen Caster</i></p>Looking Good in Print is celebrating 15 years in print with the sixth edition.

In addition, a chapter on technique explains the most important sleights &#x2015; the overhand shuffle, riffle shuffle, false cut, palm, simple pass, double lift, glide, and force. <br>Based on a volume compiled by Dr. Wilhelm Von Deusen and Glenn G. Gravatt, this collection was thoroughly revised by Jean Hugard and completely rewritten. It is easily the finest single compendium of classic card tricks, and the clear style makes the instructions easy to follow. An indispensable book for the professional or amateur magician, it is a magnificent source for anyone who wants just the right tricks to mystify his friends or delight his children.</p><p></p><h2>Integrated Behavioral Health in Primary Care: Step-by-Step Guidance for Assessment and Intervention</h2><p>The authors of this book draw on years of experience to provide practical information for behavioural care practitioners who wish to work effectively in this fast-paced setting. Interwoven through each chapter are practical tips for success and traps to avoid.</p><p>These four highly experienced behavioral health consultants (BHCs) use the 5A's model of behavior change (assess, advise, agree, assist, arrange) to offer insightful instruction to medical and behavioral health providers working together in primary care settings. Relying on rigorous reviews of evidence as well as creativity derived from experience, the authors methodically address the most common problems in primary care, ranging from postpartum depression to prescription medication abuse. This is a desktop reference for practicing BHCs and a basic text for health psychology and medical social work students. <br>--Patricia J. Robinson, PhD, author of Behavioral Consultation and Primary Care and Treating Depression in Primary Care <p>This text is the `missing behavioral link' for the family physician. It is both The 5-Minute Consultant and a valuable reference text all wrapped up in one. I will use it often and heartily recommend it to colleagues who want to provide better care. <br>--Thomas McKnight, MD, MPH, AFR, Col., Family Medicine Clinic, Hurlburt Field, FL </p><p>The authors have provided an extraordinary set of resources for behavioral health professionals working in primary care. They offer a useful conceptual framework to guide practice as well as a toolbox replete with sample transcripts, checklists, and patient handouts. <br>--Cynthia D. Belar, PhD, ABPP, Executive Director, Education Directorate, American Psychological Association; coauthor of Clinical Health Psychology in Medical Settings: A Practitioner's Guidebook, Second Edition </p><p>This book describes and embodies the best of behavioral health consultant practice. It is focused, economical, practical, and capable of making a crucial difference. It gives the reader a plethora of useful tools and careful instructions on how to use them. It is grounded in evidence and built on experience. I think its usefulness will keep growing as behavioral health practice in primary care grows beyond co-located separate services into an integrated approach that is as undifferentiated as the needs of the patients we serve. <br>--Alexander Blount, EdD, Director of Behavioral Science, Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worster </p><p>This timely volume is important for all administrators, psychologists, and physicians who focus on the reality that there is no effective primary health care without the integration of medicine and psychology. The authors have gone through the trials, tribulations, and successes of generating behavioral health and medicine collaboration. Through this volume they share the insight and knowledge gained from their initiatives. <br>--Rodger Kessler, PhD, ABPP, Berlin Family Health, Fletcher Allen Health Care, Montpelier, VT</p></p><h2>Theory Construction and Model-Building Skills: A Practical Guide for Social Scientists (Methodology in the Social Sciences)</h2><p><p>Meeting a crucial need for graduate students and newly minted researchers, this innovative text provides hands-on tools for generating ideas and translating them into formal theories. It is illustrated with numerous practical examples drawn from multiple social science disciplines and research settings. The authors offer clear guidance for defining constructs, thinking through relationships and processes that link constructs, and deriving new theoretical models (or building on existing ones) based on those relationships. Step by step, they show readers how to use causal analysis, mathematical modeling, simulations, and grounded and emergent approaches to theory construction. A chapter on writing about theories contains invaluable advice on crafting effective papers and grant applications. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Useful pedagogical features in every chapter include: </p><p>*Application exercises and concept exercises. </p><p>*Lists of key terms and engaging topical boxes. </p><p>*Annotated suggestions for further reading.</p></p><p><p><b>James Jaccard </b>is Professor of Psychology and Director of the Institute for Child Health and Development at Florida International University in Miami.

The text provides clear examples of how researchers and graduate students can formulate conceptual models, grapple with issues of measurement, and choose the most appropriate data-analytic methods for their conceptual frameworks. The authors have done an exceptional job of providing detailed instruction in the formulation and development of strong theories of behavior. Jaccard and Jacoby have written a high-quality, clear, and useful text. I highly recommend this text for graduate-level research courses and for applied researchers focused on the development of rigorous theoretical frameworks."--Vincent Guilamo-Ramos, PhD, LCSW, Columbia University School of Social Work&nbsp;"I know of no better introduction to theory development and hypothesis testing in the social sciences. Jaccard and Jacoby pull off an impressive high-wire act: they explore the conceptual underpinnings of science while providing lots of good, practical advice; they cover a wide range of approaches while avoiding oversimplification; and they offer an epistemologically principled yet inclusive vision of what social science is and could be."--Philip E. Tetlock, PhD, Mitchell Endowed Chair, Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley&nbsp;"Too often, students just study the writings and theories of others, and are left on their own when it comes to developing theory directly relevant to their research problems. Jaccard and Jacoby have written a wonderful, practical guide to help budding and experienced social scientists do just that. The book is clearly written and well organized. It would make an excellent text for graduate students from a variety of social science fields."--Kenneth A. Bollen, PhD, H. R. Immerwahr Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Director, Howard W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill &nbsp;"Filling an important gap, this book is very well written and impressive in its coverage.

It will tighten up your own thinking as well as how you present your theoretical models to others. It will enable you to write better grant proposals, and could help make the difference between a fundable score and a nonfundable score."--Rob Turrisi, PhD, Department of Biobehavioral Health, Pennsylvania State University <p></p><br><br>"This book is aimed to provide social scientists with hand-on tools for defining concepts and formalizing theories. It is particularly addressed to graduate students and it ranges from causal analysis to mathematical modeling, from simulation to grounded and emergent approaches to theory construction. It is well organized, includes many simple and effective examples, and has a very clear setup. At the end of each chapter, the authors provide a summary, concluding comments, and suggested readings. The latter are complemented by a sentence about the content of each referenced literature, which is very helpful to find the respective reference of interest. Above, an index with key terms of each chapter and intuitive exercises to deepen the understanding of it are provided. Doing so, the book is very suitable for didactical purpose, in particular for research courses to graduate students. The effective, easy-to-understand, and straightforward style of writing is noticeable since from the first pages of the book....The book is highly recommendable for social science students, is a good lecture for young and open minded researchers, and locates simulation at the core of the scientific endeavour."

An essential reference for every serious reader of the Bible.<br><br>B &amp; W illustrations and line-art throughout.In the past 30 years , there have been three major encyclopedic Bible dictionaries published in English: The Interpreter's Bible Dictionary (IBD ), the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible , and The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia ( ISBE ). When it was published in 1962 (with a supplementary volume in 1976), the IBD represented the state of critical Biblical scholarship. The ISBE , though an extensive revision of the previous edition (1929), retained many articles from its predecessors (1915 and 1929). Because of the numerous developments in biblical scholarship during the past three decades, the editor felt (rightly) that it was time for a Bible dictionary that would represent the current state of the discipline. The Anchor Bible Dictionary ( ABD ) is the result of his vision. The ABD is both international and interconfessional, with nearly 1000 contributors from around the world representing Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim traditions (and also those of no religious tradition). The list of contributing scholars includes names long associated with biblical and theological studies. The currency of the dictionary as a whole is reflected especially in the inclusion of such subjects as the Dead Sea Scrolls, early Jewish-Christian relations, the historical Jesus, and sociological and literary methods of biblical criticism (including feminist hermeneutics), and in numerous entries on archaeological sites. In addition, the bibliographies are usually up to date and often extensive. Unlike previous Bible dictionaries, the bibliographic entries in the ABD are complete citations, listed individually rather than in a run-on fashion, and hence easier to use. Even in such a monumental success as the ABD , there are weak spots. One might expect to find pronunciations, especially for place and personal names--which is the case with the IBD and the ISBE --but none are given here. There are few illustrations throughout. The maps are inadequate, and some of the topics are handled clumsily. Yet overall, this is a solid piece of work, well written and well edited. It will serve scholars and students because of its currency and thoroughness and lay readers because of its generally readable style. The ABD deserves a place on the shelves beside the standard Bible dictionaries of previous generations and is recommended for public, academic, and seminary libraries.<br><i>- Craig W.

Through in-depth research, Alpert tells the stories of the Jewish businessmen who owned and promoted teams as they both acted out and fell victim to pervasive stereotypes of Jews as greedy middlemen and hucksters. Some Jewish owners produced a kind of comedy baseball, akin to basketball's Harlem Globetrotters--indeed, Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein was very active in black baseball--that reaped financial benefits for both owners and players but also played upon the worst stereotypes of African Americans and prevented these black "showmen" from being taken seriously by the major leagues. But Alpert also shows how Jewish entrepreneurs, motivated in part by the traditional Jewish commitment to social justice, helped grow the business of black baseball in the face of the oppressive Jim Crow restrictions, and how radical journalists writing for the Communist <em>Daily Worker</em> argued passionately for an end to baseball's segregation. In fact, the campaign to convince manager Branch Rickey to integrate the Brooklyn Dodgers was initiated by Daily Worker sports writer Bill Mardo, in an open letter in the paper. <br><br>Deftly written and meticulously researched, <em>Out of Left Field</em> offers a unique perspective on the economic and social negotiations between blacks and Jews in the first half of the 20th century, shedding new light on the intersection of race, religion, and sports in America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Rebecca Alpert</strong> is Associate Professor of Religion and Women's Studies at Temple University and the author of <em>Whose Torah?: A Concise Guide to Progressive Judaism</em>.<br><br>"A major scholarly achievement...

While Germany is generally regarded as the senior power, Christian Goeschel demonstrates just how much history has underrepresented Mussolini&#x2019;s influence on his German ally.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this highly readable book, Goeschel, a scholar of twentieth-century Germany and Italy, revisits all of Mussolini and Hitler&#x2019;s key meetings and asks how these meetings constructed a powerful image of a strong Fascist-Nazi relationship that still resonates with the general public. His portrait of Mussolini draws on sources ranging beyond political history to reveal a leader who, at times, shaped Hitler&#x2019;s decisions and was not the gullible buffoon he's often portrayed as. The first comprehensive study of the Mussolini-Hitler relationship, this book is a must-read for scholars and anyone interested in the history of European fascism, World War II, or political leadership.</p><p><b>Christian Goeschel</b> is senior lecturer in modern European history at the University of Manchester, and he has held a visiting position at the European University Institute in Florence. His publications include <i>Suicide in Nazi Germany.</i> He lives in Manchester, UK.&#x201c;Goeschel, contends, convincingly, that the partnership [between Mussolini and Hitler], despite its many flaws, was &#x2018;decisive in destroying the inter-war Wilsonian order.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Joseph C. Goulden, <i>Washington Times</i><br>&#x201c;A welcome addition to the World War II library. Christian Goeschel restores the Duce to the wartime narrative . . . [and] concludes with an eye to historical memory. After the war, both sides blamed the other for defeat: German generals railing on in their memoirs about Italian military incompetence, the Italians turning themselves into passive bystanders and helpless victims of German violence. . . . Perhaps this very fine book will help them to remember.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robert M. Citino, <i>World War II </i>Magazine<br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Goeschel throws fresh light on the convoluted relationship of the two dictators. . . . In the end, Goeschel, demonstrates that there was a real friendship between the two, albeit fraught with jealousy, misunderstanding, and personal ambitions, which helped shape the war. <i>Mussolini and Hitler </i>is a valuable read for anyone interested in the leadership of the Axis powers.&#x201d;&#x2014;A. A. Nofi, <i>Strategy Page</i><br>&#x201c;Through meticulous dissection of the novel choreography and symbolism of modern dictators, with special focus on the constructed imagery of the meetings between Mussolini and Hitler, Christian Goeschel's excellent book is able to cast more light than any previous historian has done on the cynical self-serving character of their increasingly catastrophic &#x2018;special relationship&#x2019;.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ian Kershaw<br>&#x201c;Fascinating, deeply researched and well-written. This promises to be the definitive study of the Mussolini-Hitler relationship.&#x201d;&#x2014;Lucy Riall, author of <i>Garibaldi</i><br></p><h2>Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam (Modern War Studies)</h2><p>During the Vietnam war, the U.S. sought to undermine Hanoi's subversion of the Saigon regime by sending Vietnamese operatives behind enemy lines. A secret to most Americans, this covert operation was far from secret in Hanoi: all of the commandos were killed or captured, and many were turned by the Communists to report false information. <p><i>Spies and Commandos</i> traces the rise and demise of this secret operation--started by the CIA in 1960 and expanded by the Pentagon beginning in1964--in the first book to examine the program from both sides of the war. Kenneth Conboy and Dale Andrad interviewed CIA and military personnel and traveled in Vietnam to locate former commandos who had been captured by Hanoi, enabling them to tell the complete story of these covert activities from high-level decision making to the actual experiences of the agents. </p><p>The book vividly describes scores of dangerous missions-including raids against North Vietnamese coastal installations and the air--dropping of dozens of agents into enemy territory--as well as psychological warfare designed to make Hanoi believe the "resistance movement" was larger than it actually was. It offers a more complete operational account of the program than has ever been made available--particularly its early years--and ties known events in the war to covert operations, such as details of the "34-A Operations" that led to the Tonkin Gulf incidents in 1964. It also explains in no uncertain terms why the whole plan was doomed to failure from the start. </p><p>One of the remarkable features of the operation, claim the authors, is that its failures were so glaring. They argue that the CIA, and later the Pentagon, were unaware for years that Hanoi had compromised the commandos, even though some agents missed radio deadlines or filed suspicious reports. Operational errors were not attributable to conspiracy or counterintelligence, they contend, but simply to poor planning and lack of imagination. </p><p>Although it flourished for ten years under cover of the wider war, covert activity in Vietnam is now recognized as a disaster. Conboy and Andrad's account of that episode is a sobering tale that lends a new perspective on the war as it reclaims the lost lives of these unsung spies and commandos.</p></p><p>"A major work that goes beyond what is in any of the other books that touch on these aspects of the Vietnam war-including Sedgwick Tourison's <i>Secret Army, Secret War</i>."--John Prados, author of <i>The Hidden History of the Vietnam War</i> <p>"<i>Spies and Commandos</i> is full of enlightening and fascinating details. Conboy and Andrad deserve praise for their diligent research, cogent analysis, and significant contribution to understanding America's secret war in Vietnam."--H. R.

African American Studies. Set in Yvonne Vera&#39;s native country of Zimbabwe, NEHANDA tells the story of a late nineteenth century village where a young woman has been given a divine calling: the gift to inspire a war. Told in beautifully lucid and evocative prose, this is the portrait of resistance and struggle, a tale of a people&#39;s first meeting with colonialism. A stunning, beautiful and poetic novel. --The Herald (Zimbabwe)</p><p>In a Zimbabwe village, in the late nineteenth century, amidst disturbing reports of strangers on their land, people gather to perform ceremonies to wecome a new-born. They call her Nehanda, and she had come bearing signs of specialness. When Nehanda grows into a young woman the nature of her gift finaly becomes evident. She has been chosen by the ancestral spirits to inspire a war against the invaders, who have attined a strangehold on the land. And so the course of events unfolds, leading to its inevitable conclusion. <p> Told in beautifully lucid and evocative prose, this is the story of a people's first meeting with colonialism.</p>Yvonne Vera&nbsp;was born in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.

The Altai Kazakhs are unique in their tradition of using golden eagles to hunt on horseback. The lifestyle of these hunters, known in Kazakh as burtkitshis, is changing rapidly, and over the last few years the award-winning photographer Palani Mohan has spent time with these men and their families, documenting a culture under threat.<br><br>The special bond between a hunter and his eagle begins when the hunter takes an eagle pup from a nest high on the rock face. The pups are usually about four years old (a golden eagle can live to 30 years of age). It&#x2019;s important that the pup has learned to hunt and is not still dependent on her mother; but neither can she be too old nor experienced, or she will not learn to live with humans. The hunters take only female pups from the nest, as females are larger and more powerful and aggressive than the males. Adult female golden eagles can have a wingspan of up to 9 feet, and weigh over 15 pounds.<br><br>The eagle pup gradually learns to accept food from the hunter, and once trust has been established, the hunter begins to train the bird. The hunters describe the eagle as part of their family. The eagle takes pride of place in the home most of the time except during the day in the summer months or the warmest part of the day in the winter months. While all the men in the family handle the eagle, only the man who took her from the nest hunts with her.<br><br>Hunting takes place in winter, when temperatures can plummet to minus 40 degrees Farenheit. The birds are carried in swaddling, which the hunters claim keeps them both warm and calm. The strong bond between hunter and eagle is strengthened by the amount of time they spend together. Hunting trips can last many days, as the hunter and eagle trek up to a mountain ridge to obtain a good view across the landscape. Once the prey usually a fox is spotted, the hunter charges towards it to flush it into the open, then releases the eagle to make the kill. Hunters traditionally wear fur coats made from the skins of the prey their eagle has caught.<br><br>The relationship between hunter and eagle typically lasts six to eight years, then the eagle is released back into the wild to breed. One hunter tells Mohan: You love them as your own, even when you set them free at the end.&#x2019;<br><br>In his book, which comprises an introductory essay and 90 dramatic duotone images, Mohan explains how the burkitshis are slowing dying out. Rather than endure the brutal winters, their children choose to move to the capital, Ulan Bator, for a better way of life. There are also fewer golden eagles in the Altai Mountains. Although the Golden Eagle Festival&#x2019; takes place every October to showcase the ancient art of hunting with eagles, attracting tourists from across the world, there are only between 50 and 60 true&#x2019; hunters left. This book is therefore a timely, important record of these proud men and their magnificent eagles in a remote, unforgiving part of the planet.<br></p><p>Palani Mohan: Palani Mohan is a photographer whose work has been featured in many international publications, including National Geographic, Stern, Geo, the New York Times, Time and Newsweek.

Augustin would have given his life for that smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are perfect,&#x201d; Solange said. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The child nodded gravely.<br> <br>After due consideration Solange said, &#x201c;We shall name you Ruth.&#x201d;<br> <br>Solange had never wanted a baby. She accepted her duty to bear children (as it was Augustin&#x2019;s failed duty to initiate them), and with enough wet nurses and servants to cope with infant disagreeableness, Solange would rear the heirs the Forniers and Escarlettes expected.<br> <br>But as a child, while her sisters happily advised, reproved, and dressed blank-eyed porcelain dolls, Solange dressed and advised only herself. She thought her sisters too willingly accepted Eve&#x2019;s portion of that primordial curse.<br> <br>Ruth was perfect: old enough to care for herself and appreciate her betters without asking too much of them. Malleable and willing, Ruth brightened Solange&#x2019;s days. She wasn&#x2019;t the precious, awful burden an Escarlette baby would be. If Ruth disappointed, there were buyers.<br> <br>Solange dressed Ruth as her sisters had dressed their dolls. Although lace was scarce, Ruth&#x2019;s hems were fringed with Antwerp&#x2019;s finest. Ruth&#x2019;s pretty silk cap was as lustrous brown as the child&#x2019;s eyes.<br> <br>Since Ruth spoke French, Solange supposed her family had included house servants. Solange never asked: her Ruth was born, as if in her own bed, the day Solange named her.<br> <br>One quiet evening, before Solange closed the shutters against the night air, a pensive Ruth sat at the window overlooking the city. In that dim, forgiving light, she was a small black African as mysterious as that savage continent and just as assured as one of its queens.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ruth, ch�rie!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oui, madame!&#x201d;<br> <br>Instantly so agreeable, so grateful to be Solange&#x2019;s companion. Ruth admired those characteristics Solange most admired in herself. Ruth accompanied her mistress to the balls and theater, curling up somewhere until Solange was ready to go home.<br> <br>Assuaging Solange&#x2019;s grave loneliness, Ruth sat silently on the floor pressed against her mistress&#x2019;s legs. Sometimes Solange thought the child could see through her heart to the Saint-Malo seashore she loved: the rocky beaches and impregnable seawall protecting its citizens from winter storms.<br> <br>With Ruth, Solange could drop her guard. She could be afraid. She could weep. She could even indulge the weak woman&#x2019;s prayer that somehow, no matter what, everything would turn out all right.<br> <br>She read fashionable novels. Like the sensitive young novelists, Solange understood what had been lost in this modern 19th century was more precious than what remained, that human civilization had passed its high point, that today was no different from yesterday, that her soul was scuffed and diminished by banal people, banal conversation, and the myriad offenses of life. The daily privations of a besieged city were no less banal for being fatal.<br> <br>Captain Fornier was stationed at Fort Vilier, the largest of the forts ringing the city. The insurgents often tried and as often, with terrible losses, failed to penetrate the French forts&#x2019; interlocking cannon fire. Sometimes Captain Fornier stayed at the fort, sometimes at home. The flavor of his bitterness lingered after he departed. Solange would have comforted Augustin if she could without surrendering anything important.<br> <br>Nothing in Saint-Domingue was solid. Everything teetered on its last legs or was already half swallowed by the island&#x2019;s dusty vines.<br> <br>There&#x2019;d be no French fleet fighting their way through the British squadron. No reinforcements, no more cannon or muskets or rations or powder or ball. Without a murmur the Pearl of the Antilles faded into myth. Patriotic dodderers urged uncompromising warfare while Napoleon&#x2019;s soldiers deserted to the rebels or tried to survive another day.<br> <br>As their dominion shrank, the French declared carnival: a spate of balls, theatrical performances, concerts, and assignations defied the rebels at the gate. Military bands serenaded General Rochambeau&#x2019;s Creole mistresses, and a popular ballad celebrated his ability to drink lesser men under the table.<br> <br>American ships that slipped through the blockade sold cargoes of cigars and champagne and departed with desperate military dispatches and Rochambeau&#x2019;s booty. Smoke rolled in from the countryside to choke the city until dusk, when it was dispersed by the sea breeze and the hum of clouds of mosquitoes. It rained. Great crashing rains overflowed gutters and drove humans and dogs to shelter.<br> <br>Solange forbade Ruth to speak Creole. &#x201c;We must cling to what civilization we can, yes?&#x201d; When their cook ran off and Augustin could not secure another, Ruth made fish soups and fried plantain, while Solange perched on a tall stool, reading to her.<br> <br>High officers sent officers on desperate missions in order to comfort their widows.<br> <br>In Saint-Louis Square, General Rochambeau burned three Negroes alive. In an ironical moment he crucified others on the beach at Monticristi Bay.<br> <br>Every morning, Solange and Ruth strolled the oceanfront. One morning, the quay was packed with chained Negroes. &#x201c;Madame, we are loyal French colonial troops,&#x201d; one black man shouted. Why tell her?<br> <br>Ruth wanted to speak, so Solange hurried her along.<br> <br>Two frigates sailed out into a beautiful day on the bay, and at low tide, three mornings later, the wide white beach was littered with drowned Negroes. The flat, metallic smell of death set Solange to gasping. When Solange complained to Captain Fornier, his weary, tolerant smile was a stranger&#x2019;s. &#x201c;What else would you have us do with them, madame?&#x201d;<br> <br>For the first time, Solange was afraid of her husband.<br> <br>The morning everything changed, Solange awoke to Ruth humming and the piquant odor of coffee.<br> <br>Solange pushed the shutters open on a dejected straggle of soldiers below. What day was it? Would Augustin come home today? Would the rebels mount their final attack?<br> <br>Ruth said, &#x201c;What does Madame wish?&#x201d;<br> <br>What indeed? How could she be so discontented without intending anything?<br> <br>Solange touched the gold rim of her cobalt blue cup. These walls, the walls of her home, were brute unplastered stone. Shutters of some native wood were unpainted. Ruth&#x2019;s eyes, like the delicate cup, were rich, complex, and beautiful. Solange said, &#x201c;I have done nothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ruth might have said, &#x201c;What ought you have done?&#x201d; but she didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;Like a silly amateur sailor I have drifted into very deep water.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ruth might have corrected this self-appraisal but didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are in grave danger.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ruth smiled. The morning sun haloed her head. Ruth said, &#x201c;Madame will attend General Rochambeau&#x2019;s ball?&#x201d;<br> <br>Solange Fornier was Charles Escarlette&#x2019;s daughter, redoubtable and shrewd. Why was she reading sentimental novels?<br> <br>Ruth said, &#x201c;The general&#x2019;s ball will be held on a ship.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does he mean to drown his guests?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ruth&#x2019;s face went blank. Had she known one of those doomed prisoners? Solange sipped her coffee. At her impatient gesture, Ruth added sugar.<br> <br>A cobalt blue teacup on a rude plank table. Sugar. Coffee. La Sucarie du Jardin. The Pearl of the Antilles. The air was clear and cool. Had the insurgents burned everything flammable? Solange could smell the faintest hint of the island&#x2019;s beguiling florescence. How beautiful it all might have been!<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Solange said. &#x201c;What will I wear?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps the green voile?&#x201d;<br> <br>Solange put her finger to her chin. &#x201c;Ruth, will you accompany me?&#x201d;<br> <br>She curtsied. &#x201c;As you wish.&#x201d;<br> <br>Solange frowned. &#x201c;But what do you wish?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish whatever Madame wishes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then tonight, you shall be my shield.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Madame?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ch�rie. The green voile would be best.&#x201d;<br> <br>When Augustin came home that afternoon, she surprised him with a kiss. He unbuckled his sword belt and sat heavily on the bed stretching his legs so Ruth could pull his boots off. &#x201c;Poor dear Augustin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>His puzzled frown.<br> <br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t cut out to be a soldier. I should have known&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am a soldier, an officer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Augustin, I know. Your frock coat. It is in our sea trunk?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged. &#x201c;I suppose. I haven&#x2019;t seen it in months.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Make it presentable.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are we going somewhere? The theater? Some ball or another? You know I detest these amusements.&#x201d;<br> <br>She touched his lips. &#x201c;We are leaving Saint-Domingue, dear husband.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am a captain,&#x201d; he repeated stupidly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, my captain. Your honor is safe with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Perhaps Augustin should have asked what and when and why, but he was exhausted and this was too complicated. He pulled off his uniform jacket. In socks and pantaloons he flopped back, grunted, and began snoring.<br> <br>He has aged, Solange thought&#x2014;surprised by her husband&#x2019;s lined, weary countenance. She fled this too tender mood with self-reproach: why have I abdicated my responsibility? Why should a Fornier determine the future of an Escarlette? &#x201c;Rest, my brave captain. Soon, our troubles will be over.&#x201d;<br> <br>No, Solange didn&#x2019;t know what she would do She had no words for the bright life flooding through her, that something that set her eyes and feet and fingertips tingling. She was certain of only one thing: they must escape the small island. They had nothing here, neither plantation nor rank, nor the false assurance that today would be the same as yesterday. If they stayed they would be killed.<br> <br>Solange would know what to do after she&#x2019;d done it.<br> <br>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;<br> <br>It was pure Gallic genius to transform the poor old barnacle-�encrusted, blockaded Herminie from a cannon-puffing, shot-�hurling French flagship into an Arabian seraglio, with red and blue and green and gold scrims fluttering from yards and braces, potted palms stationed on the gun deck, and lamps and candles positioned to imperfectly illuminate nooks as lovers&#x2019; havens. A military band tooted gallantly, and officers in plumed silver helmets toasted �Creole mistresses while Negroes in red and blue turbans slipped among them recharging glasses. In a palm grove on the quarterdeck, Major General Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, Vicomte de Rochambeau, greeted his guests. General Rochambeau was explaining the American Revolution (where he&#x2019;d been his father&#x2019;s aide-de-camp) to an American merchant captain. &#x201c;Captain Caldwell, do you really believe that General Cornwallis surrendered to General Washington at Yorktown, ending the war and ensuring American independence? You do? Ah, Mrs. Fornier. You have neglected us of late. When was the last time we had the pleasure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the theater was it? That miscast Moli�re?&#x201d;<br> <br>The patch on the general&#x2019;s powdered cheek may have covered a chancre, and when he pressed his lips to her hand, Solange repressed an urge to wipe it. &#x201c;My dear general. In your company I had begun to fear for my virtue.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rochambeau chuckled. &#x201c;Dear Mrs. Fornier, how you flatter me. Allow me to introduce Captain Caldwell. Captain Caldwell is Bostonian. The captain may be the only incorruptible man in Cap-Fran�ais. Certainly his is the only neutral ship.&#x201d;<br> <br>The general&#x2019;s smile, like the man himself, was fleshy. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t ask how many of my bravest officers have offered Captain Caldwell bribes&#x2014;&#x2018;just a small cabin, monsieur&#x2019;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x2018;a place in the sail locker&#x2019;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x2018;deck passage&#x2019;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Captain, no names, please. I need my illusions intact.&#x201d;<br> <br>The American shrugged. &#x201c;Money&#x2019;s no good if you aren&#x2019;t alive to spend it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rochambeau had taken Captain Caldwell to Monticristi Bay, where skeletal remains testified as only they could. Rochambeau beamed. &#x201c;How true. How very true.&#x201d; He patted Ruth on the head. &#x201c;Charming child&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. charming&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Solange withdrew, the general resumed his history lesson. &#x201c;Lord Cornwallis was so chagrined at his defeat he wouldn&#x2019;t attend the surrender ceremony, so, at the appropriate moment Cornwallis&#x2019;s aide offered his sword to my father, the Comte de Rochambeau. The British surrendered to us French&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>The American guffawed. &#x201c;That makes your father our first president. Anybody tell George Washington &#x2019;bout that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Solange whispered, &#x201c;Discover. Learn everything you can,&#x201d; and Ruth vanished like smoke.<br> <br>The island&#x2019;s passionate, primitive girls had rather disappointed Napoleon&#x2019;s officers. Sad experience had proven that every alluring Creole girl had a brother in jail or a sister with a sick baby or an aged parent who couldn&#x2019;t pay his rent. These dark-skinned succubi brought as many complications as satisfactions into their beds.<br> <br>Solange&#x2019;s usual escort, Major Brissot, was drunk, sprawled against the mainmast and barely able to raise his polished cuirassier&#x2019;s helmet. She flirted dutifully with admirers, but what these gallants took for vivacity (some thought desire) was impatience. She knew what she wanted but not how.<br> <br>Blackmail? On Saint-Domingue, who wasn&#x2019;t corrupt? Who cared how many Negroes Colonel X had tortured and killed? General Y&#x2019;s betrayal of French plans to the insurgents? Pish! Major D&#x2019;s sale of French cannon to the enemy marked a new low, but, given the opportunity, what practical man wouldn&#x2019;t have done the same?<br> <br>In the end, Solange&#x2019;s suitors sought easier conquests, and, beside her untouched champagne glass, she perched on the capstan waiting for Ruth and the child&#x2019;s espionage. The moon marched across the sky, the military band grew discordant and put their instruments down. Laughter, glassware clinking, a curse, a shriek, more laughter. The American captain had gone off with a Creole girl. General Rochambeau had disappeared into the admiral&#x2019;s cabin.<br> <br>Chewing a heel of bread, Ruth perched on the capstan beside her mistress. She belched, covered her mouth, and apologized.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br> <br>Whenever the wind changed and blew the British blockaders off station, Captain Caldwell would sail with many heavy chests (thought to contain treasure) consigned by General Rochambeau and an official pouch with military reports and favored officers&#x2019; requests for transfer carried by the general&#x2019;s personal courier, Major Alexandre Brissot, Rochambeau&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s son.<br> <br>Alexandre had been shipped to the colony for conduct which, while not absolutely unknown was best practiced in a small&#x2014;a very small&#x2014;circle of peers. Alexandre had been indiscreet. Here, on the small island where murder, torture, and rape were commonplace, he&#x2019;d been indiscreet again.<br> <br>&#x201c;He is a pede.&#x201d; Ruth finished her bread and licked her fingers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course he is. Major Brissot is the only French officer who always treats ladies courteously.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Alexandre disgrace General Rochambeau.&#x201d;<br> <br>Solange blinked. &#x201c;How could anything disgrace&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Alexandre and that boy, Joli.

He then presented an introductory overview of his ideas about psychological typology and the archetypes of the collective unconscious, illustrated with case material and discussions concerning contemporary art. He focused particularly on the contra-sexual elements of the personality, the anima and the animus, which he discussed with the participants through psychological analyses of popular novels, such as Rider Haggard's She.

Kent Edwards recalls a story that late pastor J. Vernon McGee told about seeing children in South Africa playing a game of marbles in the dust with real diamonds. The precious stones were being handled with no regard for their true worth. Edwards fears the same thing happens today when preachers offer Scriptural truth to listeners without being completely overwhelmed by its greatness themselves in the process.</p><i></i><p><i>Deep Preaching </i>is his call to "rethink" preaching. Edwards helps preachers learn to preach the word in ways that will powerfully change the lives of hearers. He contends that sermons "need not settle comfortably on the lives of the listeners like dust on a coffee table." He encourages preachers to join him in casting off the lines that moor their ministries to the status-quo and make every effort to steer their preaching out of the "comfortable shallows." He urges them to preach deep sermons rather than superficial ones, moving "beyond the yawn-inspiring to the awe-inspiring, from the trite to the transforming."</p></p><p><b>J.

Illustrated notes throughout the text explain the historical background of the story.During one of his several adventurous voyages in the 1600s, an Englishman becomes the sole survivor of a shipwreck and lives for nearly thirty years on a deserted island</p><p>This classic story of a shipwrecked mariner on a deserted island is perhaps the greatest adventure in all of English literature. Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.<p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of this lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.<br>Hailed as the first great English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original. All readers with a taste for adventure will relish this inexpensive edition of one of the most popular and influential books ever written.</p></p><h2>Barbara Rae</h2><p>This is the first fully illustrated monograph of Barbara Rae&#39;s career to date. One of Britain&#39;s outstanding contemporary painters, Rae is a Royal Academician and the recipient of numerous awards including two doctorates and Commander of the British Empire (CBE). Known for their use of bright and contrasting colour, Rae&#39;s paintings combine the influence of landscape and travel with painterly abstraction. Many of her paintings can be found in public collections, including the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh; the Whitworth, Manchester; Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin and the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington. Educated at Edinburgh College of Art, Barbara Rae has always been influenced by her surroundings in her work. A scholarship allowed her to explore Europe for the first time in 1966 and this was the beginning of her lifelong passion for travel. This book charts the development of her work alongside her journeys around the globe, and the chapters are thus divided topographically: from &#39;Ireland&#39; and &#39;Spain&#39; to &#39;Arizona&#39; and &#39;South Africa&#39;. The reader comes to an understanding of the importance of place in Rae&#39;s work - in particular, the human traces and patterns of history that are left on a landscape - and at the same time gains an insight into how the structure of a landscape is simply the starting point for an experimental studio process, involving paint, colour and collage, that borders on abstraction. Her &#39;pure pleasure of painting&#39; is evident in the dynamic and experimental works shown. In an extensive interview by Andrew Lambirth, Rae reveals the fascinating secrets of what goes on in her studio, such as throwing buckets of water at her paintings and working on large scale pictures on the floor; letting them accumulate splatters as part of their &#39;life&#39;. An essay by Bill Hare situates the work in its twentieth- and twenty-first-century contexts. The contribution of the authors combined with the lavish and extensive illustrations ensure that this book is an important and engaging homage to the life and work of this extraordinary painter.</p><p>Bill Hare is a lecturer in Visual and Cultural Studies at Edinburgh College of Art and has curated several exhibitions. Andrew Lambirth is the art critic for the Spectator and has written extensively on a variety of artists including Lowry and Uglow. Gareth Wardell is a writer and filmmaker.&#39;This is a strong, well-designed monograph... The authors deserve praise for their thorough and engaging writing and the illustrations brilliantly convey the power of paintings.&#39; --The Art Book</p><h2>The History of Television, 1880 to 1941</h2><p>It would be difficult to cite any technological innovation whose impact on the fabric of daily living has been as pervasive as that of television.

The first exploitation titles were built around simple concepts; Chinese Opium Den (1894), The Kiss (1896) and Fatima's Belly Dance (1897) showed exactly what they described in the title to appalled Victorians convinced the early kinetoscopes and 'flickers' were the devil&#x2019;s instruments anyway. <br><br>From that moment on titillation under the guise of moral instruction percolated throughout the early part of the 20th century with the likes of Traffic in Souls (1913), Human Wreckage (1923), Gambling With Souls (1936), Bootleg Babies (1940) and Skid Row (1943). But the skindependent sleaze industry exploded during the 1950s when shifts in censorship and the changing liberal attitudes of the times meant every whispered taboo became an easy target for prurient abuse. <br><br>Untold sums of money started being made by an intrepid bunch of gutsy showmen known by more reputable motion-picture distributors, continually outraged ratings boards and law enforcement officials as 'The Forty Thieves'. These carpetbaggers of cinema salaciousness promoted their dubious wares with extravagant claims ('Like nothing &#x2015; but nothing you've seen before &#x2015; EVER!' &#x2015; The Orgy at Lil&#x2019;s Place (1963)), over-blown advertising copy ('Scarlet girls chained to the vultures of vice &#x2015; It blasts the truth before your eyes!' &#x2015; The Vice Racket (1936)) and lurid poster designs, usually featuring semi-clad damsels in distress, promising far more than their Poverty Row budgets could ever deliver. And they raked it in for a good thirty years as such cheap thrill operations reached their zenith in the Swinging Sixties, finding its concealed subculture going more mainstream in the Seventies and finally petering out in the late Eighties when hardcore and the home video revolution saw profit margins plunge. <br><br>For every town had a Drive-In cinema on its outskirts or a seedy fleapit in their red light district, the main places such backstreet B fodder made their fortunes. None more so than in New York City and that infamous intersection at Broadway and Seventh Avenue, centred on Times Square and 42nd Street.</p><h2>Ships and Seafaring in Ancient Times</h2><p>Ever since the earliest travelers took to the water on reed rafts or inflated goatskins, ships and boats have played a paramount role in the history of the Western world. The invention of the sail about 3500 BC resulted in ever faster and more efficient water transport, and the great civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome depended on ships and seafarers for their prosperity. This entertaining book by the world&#39;s foremost authority on ancient seamanship traces the development of the boat from the most primitive craft to the powerful warships of the Greeks, the huge Roman merchant vessels, and the slender galleys of the Vikings. Professor Casson shows how the discoveries of marine archaeologists and recent experiments with full-size replicas of ancient boats have increased our knowledge of the way in which ships were built and used. Drawing upon written accounts and contemporary artistic depictions of naval battles, trading expeditions, and other voyages, he brings the world of seafaring in ancient times vividly to life.</p><p></p><h2>The Three Impostors (Essential Gothic, SF &amp; Dark Fantasy)</h2><p>Stories woven together with the devious threads of dark magic create the ultimate in horror fiction by the gruesome Arthur Machen.

He has ported Linux to devices ranging from wristwatches and music players to PDAs, VoIP phones, and even pacemaker programmers. He was a Contributing Editor and kernel columnist for <i>Linux Magazine </i>for more than two years.</p>Preface <p><b>Essential Linux Device Drivers</b></p> <p> <b>by Sreekrishnan Venkiteswaran</b> </p> <p><b>Preface</b></p> <p>It was the late nineties and at IBM, we were putting the Linux kernel on a wrist watch. The target device was tiny, but the task was turning out to be tough. The Memory Technology Devices subsystem didn't exist in the kernel, which meant that before a filesystem could start life on the watch's flash memory, we had to develop the necessary storage driver from scratch. Interfacing the watch's touch screen with user applications was complicated since the kernel's <i>input</i> event driver interface hadn't been conceived yet. Getting X-Windows to run on the watch's LCD wasn't easy since it didn't work well with framebuffer drivers. Of what use is a water-proof Linux wrist watch if you can't stream stock quotes from your bath tub? Bluetooth integration with Linux was several years away, and months were spent porting a proprietary Bluetooth stack to Internet-enable the watch. Power management support was good enough only to squeeze a few hours of juice from the watch's battery, hence we had work cut out on that front too. Linux-Infrared was still unstable, so we had to coax the stack before we could use an Infrared keyboard for data entry. And we had to compile the compiler and cross-compile a compact application-set since there were no accepted distributions in the consumer electronics space.</p> <p>Fast forward to the present: The baby penguin has grown into a healthy teenager. What took thousands of lines of code and a year in development back then, can be accomplished in a few days with the current kernels. But to become a versatile kernel engineer who can magically weave solutions, you need to understand the myriad features and facilities that Linux offers today.</p> <p><b>About the Book</b></p> <p>Among the various subsystems residing in the kernel source tree, the <b> <i>drivers/</i> </b>directory constitutes the single largest chunk and is several times bigger than the others. With new and diverse technologies arriving in popular form factors, the development of new device drivers in the kernel is accelerating steadily. The latest kernels support over 50 device driver families. </p> <p>This book is about writing Linux device drivers. It covers the design and development of major device classes supported by the kernel, including those I missed during my Linux-on-Watch days. The discussion of each driver family starts by looking at the corresponding technology, moves on to develop a practical example, and ends by looking at relevant kernel source files. But before foraying into the world of device drivers, the book introduces you to the kernel and discusses the important features of 2.6 Linux, emphasizing those portions that are of special interest to device driver writers.</p> <p><b>Audience</b></p> <p>This book is intended for the intermediate-level programmer eager to tweak the kernel to enable new devices. You should have a working knowledge of operating system concepts. For example, you should know what a system call is, and why concurrency issues have to be factored in while writing kernel code. The book assumes that you have downloaded Linux on your system, poked through the kernel sources, and at least skimmed through some related documentation. And you should be pretty good in C. </p> <p><b>Summary of Chapters</b></p> <p>The first three chapters prepare you to digest the rest of the book. Each of the next fifteen chapters discusses drivers for a specific device family. The following chapter is a hold-all for driver classes not covered thus far. The penultimate chapter discusses device driver debugging. The last chapter gives some perspective on delivery and maintenance.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 1, "Introduction,"</i> starts our tryst with Linux. It hurries you through downloading the kernel sources, making trivial code changes, and building a bootable kernel image.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 2, "A Peek Inside the Kernel,"</i> takes a brisk peek into the innards of the Linux kernel and teaches you some must-know kernel concepts. It first takes you through the boot process and then describes kernel services particularly relevant to driver development such as kernel threads, timers, concurrency, and memory management.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 3, "Getting Started with Device Drivers,"</i> gets you started with the art of writing Linux device drivers. It looks at interrupt handling, the new Linux device model, and Linux assembly. In this chapter, you'll also learn to use kernel helper interfaces such as linked lists, work queues, completion functions, and notifier chains. These helper facilities simplify your code, weed out redundancies from the kernel, and help long-term maintenance.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 4, "Character Drivers,"</i> looks at the architecture of character device drivers. Several concepts introduced in this chapter such as polling, asynchronous notification, and I/O control, are relevant to subsequent chapters as well, since many device classes discussed in the rest of the book are 'super' character devices.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 5, "Serial Drivers,"</i> explains the kernel layer that handles serial devices. The serial layer consists of low-level drivers, the TTY layer, and <i>line disciplines</i>.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 6</i>,<i> "Input Drivers,"</i> discusses the kernel's <i>input</i> subsystem that is responsible for servicing devices such as keyboards, mice, and touch panels.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 7, "The Inter-Integrated Circuit Protocol,</i>" dissects drivers for devices such as EEPROMs that are connected to the system I2C bus or SMBus. The chapter also looks at other serial technologies such as the SPI bus and one-wire bus.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 8,"PCMCIA and Compact Flash,"</i> delves into the PCMCIA subsystem. It teaches you to write drivers for devices having a PCMCIA or Compact Flash form factor.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 9, "Peripheral Component Interconnect," </i>looks at kernel support for PCI and its derivatives such as CardBus and PCI Express.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 10, "Universal Serial Bus," </i>explores USB architecture and device drivers.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 11, "Video Drivers,"</i> explains the Linux video family.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 12, "Audio Drivers," </i>describes the Linux audio family. </p> <p>C<i>hapter 13, "Block Drivers," </i>covers drivers for devices such as IDE and SCSI. It also looks at filesystem drivers.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 14, "Network Interface Cards,"</i> is dedicated to network devices. You'll learn about kernel networking data structures and how to interface network drivers with protocol layers.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 15, "Linux Without Wires,"</i> looks at driving different wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, Infrared, WiFi and cellular communication. </p> <p> <i>Chapter 16, "Memory Technology Devices," </i>discusses flash memory enablement. This chapter first looks at flash-based protocols and chipsets primarily used on embedded devices. It ends by examining drivers for the Firmware Hub found on desktops and laptops.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 17, "Embedding Linux,"</i> steps into the world of embedded Linux. It takes you through the main firmware components of an embedded solution, such as bootloader, kernel, and device drivers. Given the soaring popularity of Linux in the embedded space, it's likely that you'll use the device driver skills that you acquire from this book, to enable embedded devices.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 18, "User Mode Drivers,"</i> looks at driving different types of devices from user space. Some device drivers, especially ones that are heavy on policy and light on performance requirements, are better off residing in user land. This chapter also explains how the new ultra-scalable process scheduler improves response times of user mode drivers.</p> <p> <i>Chapter</i> <i>19, "More Devices and Drivers,"</i> takes a tour of a potpourri of driver families not covered thus far, such as Error Detection And Correction (EDAC), <i>cpufreq</i>, FireWire and ACPI.</p> <p> <i>Chapter 20, "Debugging Device Drivers,"</i> teaches about different types of debuggers that you can use to debug kernel code. In this chapter, you'll also learn to use trace tools, kernel probes, crash-dump, and profilers. When you develop a driver, be armed with the driver debugging skills that you learn in this chapter.</p> <p> <i>Chapter</i> <i>21, "Delivery and Maintenance,"</i> provides perspective on the software life cycle and ponders <i>What next?</i> </p> <p>The book is generally organized according to device and bus complexity, coupled with practical reasons of dependencies between chapters. So, we start off with basic device classes such as character, serial, and input. Next, we look at simple serial buses such as I2C and SMBus. External buses such as PCMCIA, PCI and USB follow. Video, audio, block, and network devices usually interface with the system via I/O buses, so we look at them soon after. The next three chapters are oriented towards embedded Linux, and cover technologies such as wireless networking and flash memory. User space drivers are distilled out towards the end of the book.</p> <p><b>Conventions Used</b></p> <p>Source code, function names and shell commands are written like this. The shell prompt used is " <b>bash&gt;</b> ". Filename are written in italics <i>like this</i>. Italics are also used to introduce new terms.</p> <p>Some chapters modify original kernel source files while implementing code examples. To clearly point out the changes, newly inserted code lines are prefixed with '+', and any deleted code lines with '-'.</p> <p>Sometimes, for simplicity, the book uses generic references. So if the text points you to the <i>arch/your-arch/ </i>directory<i>, </i>it should be translated for example, to <i>arch/i386/ </i>if you are compiling the kernel for the <i>x86 </i>architecture. Similarly, any mention of the <i>include/asm-your-arch/</i> directory should be read as <i>include/asm-ppc/</i> if you are for instance, building the kernel for the POWER architecture. The '*' symbol and '<i>X</i>' are occasionally used as a wild card character in filenames. So, if a chapter asks you to look at <i>include/linux/time*.h</i>, look at the header files, <i>time.h</i>, <i>timer.h</i>, <i>times.h</i> and <i>timex.h</i>, residing in the <i>include/linux/ </i>directory. If a section talks about <i>/dev/input/eventX</i> or <i>/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serioX/</i>, <i>X</i> is the interface number assigned to your device in the context of your system configuration. </p> <p>Simple regular expressions are occasionally used to compactly list function prototypes. For example, the section "<i>Direct Memory Access</i>" in <i>Chapter 9</i>, "<i>Peripheral Component Interconnect</i>", refers to pci_mapunmapdma_sync_single() instead of explicitly citing pci_map_single(), pci_umap_single(), and pci_dma_sync_single().</p> <p>Several chapters refer you to user space configuration files. For example, the section that describes the boot process opens /<i>etc/rc.sysinit</i>, while the chapter on PCMCIA drivers flips through <i>/etc/pcmcia/config.</i> The exact names and locations of such files might, however, vary according to the Linux distribution you use.</p> <p><b>Dedication</b></p> <p>This book is dedicated to the ten million visually impaired citizens of India.

The central section, an arrangement of shorter poems and a bittersweet meditation written some years ago but not collected until now, is framed by the book's most startling accomplishments. In Part II Merrill returns to the verse drama, a genre that he has not worked in since the 1950s, when 'The Bait' was produced off-Broadway. 'The Image Maker' is an exquisitely fashioned one-act play about a santero, a saint-maker, whose carved figures are objects of veneration and sources of power in his Caribbean village. The santero also practices santeria, the Latin American religion that syncretizes the Yoruba lore which the slaves brought with them from West Africa and the Catholicism imposed on them in their new world. In this exotic context, Merrill rings changes on themes developed in his epic poem The Changing Light at Sandover. Part IV, a sequence entitled 'Prose of Departure, is itself another striking departure from Merrill's recent work. Set mostly in Japan, it intertwines narratives of beginnings and endings even as it intersperses its prose with hokku in a manner reminiscent of Basho's travel journals -- though the delicately managed rhymes set Merrill's cachet upon the form. Among the other work here are poems in Sapphics and in syllabics; a villanelle whose recursions celebrate memory', and a doubled anagram, in which the English poem is shadowed by a French version"<br><br>Stephen Yenser<br><br>author of The Consuming Myth, The Work of James Merrill</p><p><b>JAMES MERRILL</b> was born on March 3, 1926, in New York City and died on February 6, 1995. From the mid-1950s on, he lived in Stonington, Connecticut, and for extended periods he also had houses in Athens and Key West. From&nbsp;<i>The Black Swan</i>&nbsp;(1946) through&nbsp;<i>A Scattering of Salts</i>&nbsp;(1995), he wrote twelve books of poems, ten of them published in trade editions, as well as&nbsp;<i>The Changing Light at Sandover</i>(1982). He also published two plays,&nbsp;<i>The Immortal Husband</i>&nbsp;(1956) and&nbsp;<i>The Bait</i>&nbsp;(1960); two novels,&nbsp;<i>The Seraglio</i>&nbsp;(1957, reissued 1987) and&nbsp;<i>The (Diblos) Notebook</i>(1965, reissued 1994); a book of essays, interviews, and reviews,&nbsp;<i>Recitative</i>&nbsp;(1986); and a memoir,&nbsp;<i>A Different Person</i>&nbsp;(1993). Over the years, he was the winner of numerous awards for his poetry, including two National Book Awards, the Bollingen Prize, the Pulitzer Prize, and the Bobbitt Prize from the Library of Congress. He was a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.Merrill, Pulitzer Prize recipient and two-time American Book Award winner, offers here an enormously far-reaching reading experience. Although the title suggests a preoccupation with the poet's internal life, his poetry moves sweepingly outward: he locates his works in Florida, the Caribbean, Rome and Japan. The genres here are as varied as his geographical settings. In the section "Prose of Departure," he writes primarily in a prose sparingly but pungently laced with verse. A one-act play, "The Image Maker," is a sharply focused parable about a puppet-maker whose creations come alive, representing, perhaps, the poet, for whom image-making is particularly relevant. Many poems are similarly self-referential. In "Morning Glory," for example, he writes, "The world at last our own to reinvent, / This or that bit gets titled 'Morning Glory.' " But the masterly wordsmith more than compensates for occasional self-conscious or whimsical excursions. With his ability to push words to their fullest potential, Merrill blends the magical and the mundane with striking power: "Violet, the sinister of blue . . . / Frost killed the vine . . . I also felt the stab / Our local color lab / Came up with images . . . .

Kikuo Johnson<br> </i>First-rate prep school, SUV, and a dream house in the heights - this was the island paradise handed to Loren Foster when he moved to Hawaii with his father six years ago. Now, with the end of high school just around the corner, his best friend, Shane, has grown distant. The rumors say its hard drugs, and Loren suspects that Shane has left him behind for a new group of friends. What sets Kikuo's drama apart is the naturalistic ease with which he explores the relationships of his characters. It is at once an unsentimental portrait of that most awkward period between adolescence and young adulthood and that rarest of things - a mature depiction of immature lives. <br></p><p>R. Kikuo Johnson was born in 1981 on the island of Maui, Hawaii. After graduation from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2003, where he studied comics under the tutelage of David Mazzucchelli, he moved to Brooklyn, NY, where he currently draws comics and plays the ukelele. His first graphic novel, Night Fisher, was published to great acclaim in late 2005, and beginning with the third issue, he contributes to the anthology MOME.&#x201c;Johnson's storytelling is clear and masterful, and his characters' body language says as much about them as their words. An exciting debut from a talent to watch.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Starred Review. Johnson draws with a confident bravado that is particularly impressive in a young cartoonist, and his narrative skills are equally assured. His depiction of Hawaii, while creating a visceral sense of place, avoids the standard "tropical paradise" cliches. Much of the story unfolds at night, allowing Johnson to show off his skill at using solid black areas to shape powerful compositions. Seldom has an artist's initial graphic novel been this accomplished and rewarding.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Drawn with sweeping black brush strokes, [<em>Night Fisher</em>] is done completely in absence of color. This, however, helps to magnify the tone of the story and brings a subtle heaviness to the work. The artwork itself is excellent.... Johnson does a great job conveying character&#x2019;s moods and emotions through angles, posture, and facial expressions. ...[I]f you enjoy these realistic and unapologetic looks at adolescence I recommend giving <em>Night Fisher</em> a read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>A. Alba, <em>Hawaii Book Blog</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The gritty coming-of-age story also delivers strong plot and dialog like a fistful of poi.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Book Collector</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Night Fisher</em> is bound to make waves.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Bust</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The honest and relatable plot keeps the readers attention without needing to fall back on cliche storytelling techniques, all the while building you to anxiously await the next installment. Hopefully Johnson will do another graphic novel with this set of characters soon.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Sparkplugg.com</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A compelling yet unsentimental coming of age story. It&#x2019;s a portrait of awkward adolescence on the cusp of adulthood illustrated with the darker, more realistic tones of teenage life. <em>Night Fisher</em> is filled with bold artwork, psychological intricacies, and mature depictions of immature actions. ... R. Kikuo Johnson has proven himself as a masterful storyteller in his first graphic novel.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steve Ponzo, <em>Multiversity Comics</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A closely observed story&#x2015;specific in its details but broadly recognizable from the lives of a million young men&#x2015;in an expressive, inky style... an excellent naturalistic story of these young men in this closely examined place.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew Wheeler, <em>The Antick Musings of G.B.H. Hornswoggler, Gent.</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Johnson is a first-rate cartoonist in so many ways....

She attributed the inferior position of women and minority racial groups in American society to class inequalities and argued, as Eugene Debs later did, that blacks were oppressed because they were poor, not because they were black. Lucy favored the availability of birth control information and contraceptive devices. She believed that under socialism women would have the right to divorce and remarry without economic, political and religious constraints; that women would have the right to limit the number of children they would have; and that women would have the right to prevent legalized&#x201d; rape in marriage.<br><br> Lucy Parsons&#x2019; life expressed the anger of the unemployed workers, women, and minorities against oppression and is exemplary of radicals&#x2019; efforts to organize the working class for social change.&#x201d;<br> From the preface<br><br>Lucy Parsons, who the Chicago police considered more dangerous than a thousand rioters,&#x201d; was an early American radical who defied all the conventions of her turbulent era as an outspoken woman of color, writer, and labor organizer. Parsons&#x2019; life as activist spanned the era of the Robber Barons through the Great Depression, during which she actively campaigned and organized for the emancipation of the working class from wage slavery. Parsons courageously led the defense campaign for the Haymarket martyrs,&#x201d; including her husband Albert Parsons. Ashbaugh&#x2019;s biography takes a giant leap toward reinterpreting the role of women in American history.</p><p></p><h2>From Walt to Woodstock: How Disney Created the Counterculture</h2><p><p>With his thumbprint on the most ubiquitous films of childhood, Walt Disney is widely considered to be the most conventional of all major American moviemakers. The adjective "Disneyfied" has become shorthand for a creative work that has abandoned any controversial or substantial content to find commercial success.</p><p>But does Disney deserve that reputation? Douglas Brode overturns the idea of Disney as a middlebrow filmmaker by detailing how Disney movies played a key role in transforming children of the Eisenhower era into the radical youth of the Age of Aquarius. Using close readings of Disney projects, Brode shows that Disney's films were frequently ahead of their time thematically. Long before the cultural tumult of the sixties, Disney films preached pacifism, introduced a generation to the notion of feminism, offered the screen's first drug-trip imagery, encouraged young people to become runaways, insisted on the need for integration, advanced the notion of a sexual revolution, created the concept of multiculturalism, called for a return to nature, nourished the cult of the righteous outlaw, justified violent radicalism in defense of individual rights, argued in favor of communal living, and encouraged antiauthoritarian attitudes. Brode argues that Disney, more than any other influence in popular culture, should be considered the primary creator of the sixties counterculture&#x2014;a reality that couldn't be further from his "conventional" reputation.</p></p><p>DOUGLAS BRODE is a playwright, screenwriter, and journalist who teaches cinema studies at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University."Brode&#x2019;s thesis is both revolutionary and totally without precedent. He steals from no one. Significance? No other moviemaker or mogul&#x2014;Louis B. Mayer, Irving Thalberg, Orson Welles, etc.&#x2014;has had such a deep and lasting impact on American popular culture as has Disney."

Robert Heilbroner, writing about Hobsbawm&#x2019;s <b>The Age of Extremes 1914-1991</b> said, &#x201c;I know of no other account that sheds as much light on what is now behind us, and thereby casts so much illumination on our possible futures.&#x201d; Skeptical, endlessly curious, and almost contemporary with the terrible &#x201c;short century&#x201d; which is the subject of <b>Age of Extremes</b>, his most widely read book, Hobsbawm has, for eighty-five years, been committed to understanding the &#x201c;interesting times&#x201d; through which he has lived. <br><br>Hitler came to power as Hobsbawm was on his way home from school in Berlin, and the Soviet Union fell while he was giving a seminar in New York. He was a member of the Apostles at King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge, took E.M. Forster to hear Lenny Bruce, and demonstrated with Bertrand Russell against nuclear arms in Trafalgar Square. He translated for Che Guevara in Havana, had Christmas dinner with a Soviet master spy in Budapest and an evening at home with Mahalia Jackson in Chicago. He saw the body of Stalin, started the modern history of banditry and is probably the only Marxist asked to collaborate with the inventor of the Mars bar. <br><br>Hobsbawm takes us from Britain to the countries and cultures of Europe, to America (which he appreciated first through movies and jazz), to Latin America, Chile, India and the Far East. With <b>Interesting Times</b>, we see the history of the twentieth century through the unforgiving eye of one of its most intensely engaged participants, the incisiveness of whose views we cannot afford to ignore in a world in which history has come to be increasingly forgotten.</p><p>Eric Hobsbawm was born in 1917 and educated in Vienna, Berlin, London and Cambridge. From 1947-1982 Hobsbawm was Professor of Economic and Social History at Birbeck College, University of London. He also taught at Stanford, MIT, Cornell, and the New School for Social Research from 1982-2001. A Fellow of the British Academy and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he is the author of more than 20 books of history including <b>The Age of Revolution</b>, <b>The Age of Capital, The Age of Empire</b>, and <b>The Age of Extremes</b>. He lives in London with his wife, Marlene.<b>Overture </b><br><br>One day in the autumn of 1994, my wife Marlene, who kept track of the London correspondence while I was teaching my course at the New School in New York, phoned me to say there was a letter from Hamburg she could not read, as it was in German. It came from a person who signed herself Melitta. Was it worth sending on? I knew no one in Hamburg, but without a moment&#x2019;s hesitation I knew who had written it, even though something like three quarters of a century had passed since I had last seen the signatory. It could only be little Litta &#x2014; actually she was my senior by a year or so &#x2014; from the Seutter Villa in Vienna. I was right. She had, she wrote, seen my name in some connection in <i>Die Zeit</i>, the German liberal-intellectual weekly. She had immediately concluded that I must be the Eric with whom she and her sisters had played long, long ago. She had rummaged through her albums and come up with a photo which she enclosed. On it five small children posed on the summery terrace of the villa with our respective Fr�uleins, the little girls &#x2014; perhaps even myself &#x2014; garlanded with .owers. Litta was there with her younger sisters Ruth and Eva (Susie, always known as Peter,was not yet born), I with my sister Nancy. Her father had marked the date on the back: 1922. And how was Nancy, Litta asked. How could she know that Nancy, three-and-a-half years my junior, had died a couple of years earlier? On my last visit to Vienna I had gone to the houses in which we had lived, and sent Nancy photographs of them. I had thought she was the only one who still shared a memory of the Seutter Villa. Now it came alive again.<br><br>I have that photo too. In the album of family photos which has ended up with me, the last survivor of my parents and siblings, the snapshots on the terrace of the Seutter Villa form the second iconographic record of my existence and the first of my sister Nancy, born in Vienna in 1920. My own first record appears to be a picture of a baby in a very large wicker pram, without adults or other context, which was, I assume, taken in Alexandria, where I was born in June 1917, to have my presence registered by a clerk at the British Consulate (incorrectly, for they got the date wrong and misspelled the surname). The diplomatic institutions of the United Kingdom presided over both my conception and my birth, for it was at another British Consulate, in Zurich, that my father and mother had been married, with the help of an of.cial dispensation personally signed by Sir Edward Grey, Foreign Secretary, which allowed the subject of King George V, Leopold Percy Hobsbaum, to marry the subject of the Emperor Franz Josef, Nelly Gr�n, at a time when both empires were at war with one another, a con.ict to which my future father reacted with residual British patriotism, but which my future mother repudiated. In 1915 there was no conscription in Britain, but if there were, she told him, he should register as a Conscientious Objector.1 I would like to think that they were married by the consul who is the main .gure in Tom Stoppard&#x2019;s play <i>Travesties</i>. I should also like to think that while they were waiting in Zurich for Sir Edward Grey to turn from more urgent matters to their wedding, they knew about their fellow-exiles in the city, Lenin, James Joyce and the Dadaists. However, they obviously did not, and almost certainly would not have been interested in them at such a time. They were plainly more concerned with their forthcoming honeymoon in Lugano.<br><br>What would have been my life if Fr�ulein Gr�n, aged eighteen, one of three daughters of a moderately prosperous Viennese jeweller, had not fallen in love with an older Englishman, fourth of eight children of an immigrant London Jewish cabinet-maker, in Alexandria in 1913? She would presumably have married a young man from the Jewish Mitteleuropean middle class, and her children would have grown up as Austrians. Since almost all young Austrian Jews ended up as emigrants or refugees, my subsequent life might not have looked very different &#x2014; plenty of them came to England, studied here and became academics. But I would not have grown up or come to Britain with a native British passport.<br><br>Unable to live in either belligerent country, my parents returned via Rome and Naples to Alexandria, where they had originally met and got engaged before thewar, and where both had relatives &#x2014;my mother&#x2019;s uncle Albert, of whose emporium of <i>Nouveautes</i> plus staff I still have a photograph, and my father&#x2019;s brother Ernest, whose name I bear and who worked in the Egyptian Post and Telegraph Service. (Since all private lives are raw material for historians as for novelists, I have used the circumstances of their meeting to introduce my history of <i>The Age of Empires</i>.) They moved to Vienna with their two-year-old son as soon as the war ended. That is why Egypt, to which I am shackled by the lifetime chains of of.cial documentation, is not part of my life. I remember absolutely nothing about it except, possibly, a cage of small birds in the zoo at Nouzha, and a corrupt fragment of a Greek children&#x2019;s song, presumably sung by a Greek nursemaid. Nor have I any curiosity about my place of birth, the district known as Sporting Club, along the tramline from the centre of Alexandria to Ramleh, but then, there is not much to be said about it, according to E. M. Forster, whose stay in Alexandria almost coincided with my parents&#x2019;. All he says about the tram station Sporting Club in his <i>Alexandria, A History and a Guide</i> is: &#x2018;Close to the Grand Stand of the Race Course. Bathing beach on the left.&#x2019;<br><br>Egypt thus does not belong in my life. I do not know when the life of memory begins, but not much of it goes back to the age of two. I have never gone there since the steamer Helouan left Alexandria for Trieste, then just transferred from Austria to Italy. I do not remember anything about our arrival in Trieste, meeting-point of languages and races, a place of opulent caf�s, sea captains and the headquarters of the giant insurance company, Assicurazioni Generali, whose business empire probably de.nes the concept of &#x2018;Mitteleuropa&#x2019; better than any other. Eighty years later I had occasion to discover it in the company of Triestine friends, and especially Claudio Magris, that marvellous memorializer of central Europe and the Adriatic corner where German, Italian, Slav and Hungarian cultures converge. My grandfather, who had come to meet us, accompanied us on the Southern Railway to Vienna. That is where my conscious life began. We lived with my grandparents for some months, while my parents looked for an apartment of their own.<br><br>My father, arriving with hard savings &#x2014; nothing was harder than sterling in those days &#x2014; in an impoverished country with a currency subsiding towards collapse, felt con.dent and relatively prosperous. The Seutter Villa seemed ideal. It was the first place in my life I thought of as &#x2018;ours&#x2019;.<br><br>Anyone who comes to Vienna by rail from the west still passes it. If you look out of the right-hand window as the train comes into the western outskirts of Vienna, by the local station Hu� tteldorf-Hacking, it is impossible to miss that con.dent broad pile on the hillside with its four-sided dome on a squat tower, built by a successful industrialist in the later days of the Emperor Franz Josef (1848&#x2014;1916). Its grounds reached down to the Auhofstrasse, which led to the west along the walls of the old imperial hunting ground, the Lainzer Tiergarten, and from which it was reached by a narrow uphill street (the Vinzenz- Hessgasse, now Seuttergasse) at the bottom of which there was then still a row of thatched cottages.<br><br>The Seutter Villa of my childhood memories is largely the part shared by the old and young of the Hobsbaums (for so, in spite of the Alexandrian consular clerk, the name was spelled), who rented a flat on the first flor of the villa, and the Golds, who rented the ground-.oor apartment below us. Essentially this centred on the terrace at the side of the house, where so much of the social life of the generations of both these families was conducted. From this terrace a footpath &#x2014; steep in retrospect &#x2014; led down to the tennis courts at the bottom &#x2014; they are now built over &#x2014; past what seemed to a small boy a giant tree, but with branches low enough for climbing. I remember showing its secrets to a boy who had come to my school from a place called Recklinghausen in Germany. We had been asked to take care of him, because times were hard where he came from. I can remember nothing about him except the tree and his home-town in what is now the Land Nordrhein- Westfalen. He soon went back. Though I did not think of it as such, this must have been my first contact with the major events of twentiethcentury history, namely the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, via one of the children temporarily sent out of harm&#x2019;s way to wellwishers in Austria. (All Austrians at that time saw themselves as Germans, and, but for a veto from the peacemakers after the First World War, would have voted to join Germany.) I also have a vivid memory of us playing in a barn full of hay somewhere in the grounds, but on my last visit to Vienna with Marlene we checked out the Villa and could .nd no place where it might have been. Curiously enough, I have no indoor memories of the place, though a vague impression that it was neither very light nor very comfortable. I cannot, for instance, recall anything about our own or the Golds&#x2019; apartments, except perhaps high ceilings.<br><br>Five, later six, children of pre-school age, or at best in the first years of primary school, in the same garden, are great cementers of inter-family relations. The Hobsbaums and the Golds got on well, in spite of their very different backgrounds &#x2014; for (notwithstanding their name) the Golds do not seem to have been Jewish. At all events they remained and .ourished in Austria, that is to say in Hitler&#x2019;s Greater German...</p><h2>Serve the People: Making Asian America in the Long Sixties</h2><p><b>A narrative history of the movement that turned &#x201c;Orientals&#x201d; into Asian Americans</b><br><br> Until the political ferment of the Long Sixties, there were no Asian Americans. There were only isolated communities of mostly Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos lumped together as &#x201c;Orientals.&#x201d; Serve the People tells the story of the social and cultural movement that knit these disparate communities into a political identity, the history of how&#x2014;and why&#x2014;the double consciousness of Asian America came to be.<br><br> At the same time, Karen Ishizuka&#x2019;s vivid narrative reveals the personal epiphanies and intimate stories of insurgent movers and shakers and ground-level activists alike. Drawing on more than 120 interviews and illustrated with striking images from guerrilla movement publications, the book evokes the feeling of growing up alien in a society rendered in black and white, and recalls the intricate memories and meanings of the Asian American movement.

She left France for Cambridge University to study History of Art at King&#39;s College, focusing in on painting in the French Revolution. She then moved to London where she now lives and put her degree to use working for an auction house. REBEL OF THE SANDS is her first novel.<b>ONE</b><br><br>They said the only folks who belonged in Deadshot after dark were the ones who were up to no good. I wasn&#x2019;t up to no good. Then again, I wasn&#x2019;t exactly up to no bad neither.&nbsp;<br><br> I slid from Blue&#x2019;s saddle and tethered her to a post behind some bar called the Dusty Mouth. The kid sitting against the fence was sizing me up suspiciously. Or maybe that was just his two black eyes. I tugged the wide brim of my hat lower as I stepped out of the yard. I&#x2019;d stolen the hat from my uncle, along with the horse. Well, borrowed, more like. Everything I owned belonged to my uncle anyway, according to law, down to the clothes on my back.<br><br> The doors of the bar banged open, spilling out light and noise and a fat drunk with his arm around a pretty girl. My hand snapped to my sheema before I could think better of it, checking it was still tightly fastened so the better part of my face was covered. I was wrapped up to my eyes, and even hours after sunset I was sweating under the padding like a sinner at prayers. I figured I looked more like some lost nomad than a real sharpshooter, but so long as I didn&#x2019;t look like a girl it didn&#x2019;t much matter. Tonight I was getting out of here with at least my life. All the better if I got out with a few coins in my pocket, too.<br><br> It wasn&#x2019;t hard to spot the pistol pit on the other side of Deadshot. It was the noisiest building in town, and that wasn&#x2019;t saying nothing. A great big gutted-out barn at the end of the dusty street, it was swarming with bodies and blazing with light, propped up against a half-collapsed prayer house with a boarded-up door. Might be that once upon a time the barn had served some honest horse trader, but that was years ago by the looks of things.<br><br> The crowd thickened the closer I got. Like buzzards swarming to a fresh carcass.<br><br> A man with a bloody nose was pinned up against a wall by two others while another drove his fist into the man&#x2019;s face over and over. A girl called out from a window with words that&#x2019;d make an iron dragger blush. A group of factory workers still in their uniforms huddled around a nomad in a busted-up wagon who was shouting about selling Djinni blood that&#x2019;d grant good folks their hearts&#x2019; desires. His wide grin looked desperate in the oily lamplight, and no wonder. It&#x2019;d been years since anyone round these parts had seen a real live First Being, let alone a Djinni. Besides, he should&#x2019;ve known better than to think desert dwellers would believe Djinn bled anything other than pure fire&#x2014;or that anyone in Deadshot would believe themselves good folk. Everybody in the Last County went to prayers enough to know better on both counts.<br><br> I tried to keep my eyes forward, like I&#x2019;d seen it all before.<br><br> If I climbed past the buildings, I&#x2019;d be able to look across the sand and scrub all the way home to Dustwalk, though there&#x2019;d be nothing but dark houses. Dustwalk got up and went down with the sun. Good honest behavior didn&#x2019;t belong to the dark hours of the night. If it were possible to die of boredom, everyone in Dustwalk would be corpses in the sand.<br><br> But Deadshot was alive and kicking.<br><br> No one paid me much mind as I slid into the barn. A big crowd was already gathered in the pistol pit. Lines of huge oil lamps hung from the eaves, giving the gawkers&#x2019; faces a greasy glow. Scrawny kids were setting up targets and dodging a big man&#x2019;s blows as he shouted at them to move faster. Orphans, by the looks of them. Likely kids whose fathers had worked in the hulking weapons factory on the outskirts of Dustwalk until they&#x2019;d gotten blown to bits by faulty machinery. Or until the day they&#x2019;d gone to work drunk and burned themselves too badly to live. Gunpowder wasn&#x2019;t hardly safe work.<br><br> I was so busy staring that I nearly walked straight into the giant of a man at the door. &#x201c;Front or back?&#x201d; he demanded, his hands resting carelessly on a scimitar on his left hip and a gun on his right.<br><br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I remembered just in time to pitch my voice lower. I&#x2019;d been practicing imitating my friend Tamid all week, but I still sounded like a boy instead of a man. The hired muscle at the door didn&#x2019;t seem to care.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s three fouza to stand at the back, five to stand at the front. Betting starts at ten.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How much to stand in the middle?&#x201d; Damn. I hadn&#x2019;t meant to say that. Aunt Farrah had been trying to smack the smart mouth off me for a year now with no luck. I got the feeling it would hurt more if this man tried.<br><br> But he just frowned like he thought I might be simple. &#x201c;Front or back. There&#x2019;s no middle, boy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not here to watch,&#x201d; I said before I could lose the last of my nerve. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to shoot.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What are you doing wasting my time, then? You want Hasan.&#x201d; He shoved me toward a heavyset man with billowing, bright red trousers and a dark beard slicked to his chin, standing behind a low table piled with coins that bounced as he drummed his fingers.<br><br> I took a deep breath through my sheema and tried to look like my stomach wasn&#x2019;t trying to escape through my mouth. &#x201c;How much to enter?&#x201d;<br><br> The scar on Hasan&#x2019;s lip made it look like it curled up in a sneer. &#x201c;Fifty fouza.&#x201d;<br><br> Fifty? That was almost everything I had. Everything I&#x2019;d been saving up in the last year to escape to Izman, the capital of Miraji.<br><br> Even with my face covered from the nose down, Hasan must&#x2019;ve seen the hesitation. His attention was already wandering past me, like he figured I was about to walk away.<br><br> That was what did it. I dropped the money on the table in a jangling handful of louzi and half-louzi that I&#x2019;d scrimped one by one over the past three years. Aunt Farrah always said I didn&#x2019;t seem to mind proving myself dumb if it meant proving someone else wrong. So maybe Aunt Farrah was right.<br><br> Hasan eyed the coins skeptically, but when he counted them with the speed of a professional money-grubber he couldn&#x2019;t deny it was all there. For a brief moment the satisfaction tamped down on my nerves.<br><br> He shoved a piece of wood at me that dangled from a loop of string like a pendant. The number twenty-seven was painted in black on it. &#x201c;Had much practice with a gun, twenty-seven?&#x201d; Hasan asked as I put the string over my head. The tag bounced off the wraps I had forced over my chest to flatten it.<br><br> &#x201c;Some,&#x201d; I hedged. We were wanting for almost everything in Dustwalk, in the whole Last County for that matter. Food. Water. Clothes. There were only two things we had too much of: sand and guns.<br><br> Hasan snorted. &#x201c;Then you ought to know enough to keep your hands from shaking.&#x201d;<br><br> I pressed my hands close to my body to still them as I walked into the pit. If I couldn&#x2019;t hold a gun steady it wouldn&#x2019;t much matter that I learned to aim before I learned to read. I lined up in the sand next to a man who looked like he was mostly bones under his grubby factory uniform. Another man came to stand on my other side with a twenty-eight around his thick neck.<br><br> All around us the stands filled. The bet wranglers shouted out odds and numbers. If I were betting, I&#x2019;d wager I didn&#x2019;t have any odds. No one in their right mind would put money on some skinny boy without the guts to even lower his sheema and show his face. Maybe I could win some crazy drunk a poor man&#x2019;s fortune by proving the right-minded ones wrong.<br><br> &#x201c;Good evening, gents!&#x201d; Hasan&#x2019;s voice carried over the crowd, quieting them down. Dozens of kids ran among us handing out the pistols. A girl with braids and bare feet passed me mine. The weight was instantly comforting in my palm. I quickly flicked open the chamber; there were six bullets neatly lined up. &#x201c;Everyone knows the rules. So you&#x2019;d better play by them or, God help me, I&#x2019;ll break your cheating faces myself.&#x201d; A laugh erupted from the stands, and a few whoops. Bottles were being passed around already and men were pointing at us in that way I knew from watching my uncle trade horses. &#x201c;Round one: you got six bullets, six bottles. If you&#x2019;ve got any bottles left at the end, you&#x2019;re out. First ten line up.&#x201d;<br><br> The rest of us stayed still as numbers one to ten shuffled into place, their toes on a painted white line in the dirt. I judged it about twelve feet between them and the bottles.<br><br> A kid could make that.<br><br> Two men still managed to miss with their very first bullets. In the end only half the men hit all their marks.<br><br> One of them was twice the size of any other competitor. He was wearing what might once have been an army uniform, though it was too worn to tell for sure whether it used to be gleaming army gold or if it was just dirty with desert dust. He wore the number one painted in a bold slash across the piece of wood on his chest. He got the biggest cheer of all. There were cries of &#x201c;Dahmad! Dahmad! Champion!&#x201d; as he turned away, grabbing one of the kids scurrying around to collect broken glass. Dahmad spoke too low for me to hear, then shoved the child off. The kid came back with a bottle of brown liquor. Dahmad started chugging, lounging against the bars that separated the pit from the stands. He wouldn&#x2019;t stay champion long if he was going to wind up sloshed.<br><br> The next round was even more dismal. Just one of the shooters hit all his targets. As the losers shuffled off, I got a clear view of the winner&#x2019;s face. Whatever I&#x2019;d been expecting, this boy wasn&#x2019;t it. He wasn&#x2019;t from around here, no doubt about it; that was the first thing I noticed. Everybody around here was from around here. Nobody in their right mind would chose to be in the Last County otherwise.<br><br> He was young, maybe a few years older than I was, and dressed like one of us, wearing a green sheema carelessly round his neck and desert clothes loose enough that it was hard to tell if he was really as broad as he seemed. His hair was as black as any Mirajin boy&#x2019;s; even his skin was dark enough that he might&#x2019;ve passed for one of us. But he just wasn&#x2019;t. He had strange sharp features I&#x2019;d never seen before, with high-angled cheekbones, a straight square jaw, and eyebrows that made dark slashes above the uncanniest eyes I&#x2019;d ever seen. He wasn&#x2019;t bad-looking either, at that. A few of the men he&#x2019;d beat spat at his feet. The young foreigner&#x2019;s mouth pulled up in one corner like he was trying to keep from laughing. Then, as if sensing my eyes on him, he glanced at me. I looked away fast.<br><br> There were eleven of us left and we were jostling for space along the line with the extra body, even with me being half the size of every man here.<br><br> &#x201c;Move, twenty-seven!&#x201d; An elbow jammed into my side. My head shot up with a retort on my tongue. The retort died there as I recognized Fazim Al&#x2019;Motem sidling up next to me.<br><br> I fought the urge to curse. Fazim had taught me every curse word I knew, back when he was eight and I was six. When we were caught using them, I got my mouth scrubbed out with sand and he blamed it all on me. Dustwalk was a small town. I&#x2019;d known Fazim my whole life, hated him since I grew into some sense. These days he spent most of his time in my uncle&#x2019;s house, where I was stuck living, too, trying to get his hands under my cousin Shira&#x2019;s clothes. Every so often he&#x2019;d make a grab at a piece of me, too, when Shira wasn&#x2019;t looking.<br><br> What the hell was he doing here? Actually, with the gun in his hand, I could sort of figure.<br><br> Damn him.<br><br> It was one thing if I got myself spotted as a girl. It was a whole other thing if Fazim recognized me. I&#x2019;d been in trouble plenty since I was caught cursing, but I&#x2019;d only been beaten within an inch of my life once. It&#x2019;d been right after my mother died, when I&#x2019;d tried to borrow one of my uncle&#x2019;s horses all the way out of Dustwalk. I made it halfway to Juniper City before they caught me. I couldn&#x2019;t sit on a horse for a month when Aunt Farrah and her switch were done with me. If Aunt Farrah found out I was in Deadshot gambling stolen money, she&#x2019;d beat me until that inch felt like it had been a mile.<br><br> The smart thing would be to turn around and get out of here. Except that would mean I&#x2019;d be fifty fouza poorer. And money was in shorter supply than smarts.<br><br> I realized I was standing like a girl and straightened up before facing the targets. The kids were still racing around, lining up the bottles. Fazim tracked their movements with the barrel of his gun, calling out, &#x201c;Bang, bang, bang!&#x201d; and laughing as they flinched. I wished his gun would backfire on him and shoot that smile off his face.<br><br> The kids cleared out fast, and it was just us shooters and our bottles. We were the last group before the end of the first round. Guns were already going off all around me. I focused on my six bottles straight ahead. I could make a shot like this blindfolded. But I was being careful. I checked my distance, lined up the barrel, checked my sight. When I was satisfied, I pulled the trigger. The bottle farthest to the right exploded and my shoulders eased a little. The next three bottles went down in quick succession.<br><br> My finger pressed down on the trigger for the fifth time. A shout punctured my focus. I had no other warning before a body rammed into me.<br><br> My shot went wide.<br><br> Fazim had been shoved sideways by another shooter, ramming into me on his way to the ground, another one of the shooters on top of him. A boo went up from the crowd as Fazim scuffled in the sand with the other man. The big man from the door was already breaking up the fight. Fazim was dragged to the side by the scruff of his neck. Hasan watched them go, looking bored, then turned back to the crowd. &#x201c;Winners from this round&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I shouted without thinking. &#x201c;I want another bullet.&#x201d;<br><br> A laugh went up around me. So much for not drawing attention to myself. My neck was burning with all the eyes on me. But this was too important. Too important not to ask. Scorn was written all over Hasan&#x2019;s face, and I felt the mix of humiliation and anger rise up in my throat in answer. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not how it works, twenty-seven. Six bullets, six bottles. No second chances.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not fair! He pushed me.&#x201d; I gestured at Fazim, who was nursing his jaw up against the wall.<br><br> &#x201c;And this isn&#x2019;t a school yard, little boy. We don&#x2019;t need to be fair. Now you can use your last bullet and lose or get out of line and forfeit.&#x201d;<br><br> I was the only one with any bullets left. The crowd started jeering at me to get out of the way, and an angry flush rose in my hidden face.<br><br> Standing alone on the line, I raised my gun. I could feel the weight of the single bullet in the chamber. I let out one long breath that moved my sheema from where it was sticking to my lips.<br> One bullet. Two bottles.<br><br> I took two steps to my right and then half a step back. I twisted my body and tried to see it all in my mind. Dead center and I&#x2019;d never hit the second one. Clip it too far off and neither would break.<br><br> Fifty fouza.<br><br> I shut out the shouting and taunts around me. I ignored the fact that every eye in here was on me and that I&#x2019;d blown all chances of being inconspicuous. Fear crept in in its place. The same fear that had crouched in my stomach for the past three days. Since the night I&#x2019;d been crawling around my uncle&#x2019;s house after dark, on my way to Tamid&#x2019;s, and overheard Aunt Farrah say my name.<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;Amani?&#x201d;<br><br> I hadn&#x2019;t caught whatever had come before my name, but it was enough to make me stop.<br> &#x201c;She...</p><h2>Messengers of God: Biblical portraits and legends</h2><p>White board covers with green cloth binding.

As his well-drawn characters wrestle with interspecies challenges, Turnbull imparts lessons that both embrace and transcend culture and race to drive at the heart of what it means to be human.'' -- <b>Tananarive Due, American Book Award winner, executive producer of Horror Noire</b></p> <p>''In <i>The Lesson</i> Cadwell Turnbull, by setting his story in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, makes something completely new of the old theme of humans' first contact with superior aliens. Putting these 'colonizing aliens' in a place shaped by colonialism opens new perspectives on issues of race and culture and sex and exploitation. But the true wonder of this novel is its beautifully realized portrayal of Charlotte Amalie and its deeply human and complex characters, young and old, all of them transformed by the arrival of the ambiguously motivated Ynaa. It's a story of mystery, romance, tragedy, and redemption. Like Octavia Butler and Ursula K. Le Guin before him, Turnbull uses the tools of science fiction to illuminate the human heart. <i>The Lesson</i> stands at the beginning of what I expect to be a long and illustrious career.'' -- <b>John Kessel, Nebula Award-winning author of <i>The Moon and the Other and Pride and Prometheus</i></b></p> <p>''A welcomed addition to the new wave of Virgin Islands literature.

Sheen : A Centennial Celebration</h2><p>Those who have no ultimate destiny for life really can never say they are making progress, if there is no fixed point, they can never say whether they are getting to their goal or not.</p><p>Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen (1895-1979), one of the 20th century&#39;s best-known and loved Catholic prelates, was a lecturer, professor, philosopher, preacher, and writer. A radio and television personality, he is widely regarded as the original media luminary for the spiritual world. This former director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith leaves behind an enormous written and oral history. In addition to two weekly syndicated newspaper columns that ran for close to two decades, he authored scores of books.This devotional collection, published to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Archbishop Sheen's birth, draws on material published over a 60-year span, from 1929 to 1989 (10 years after Sheen's death). Not surprisingly, the subject matter is varied, but much of it retains a surprisingly contemporary ring. The selections are short, practical, and down to earth. They give ample evidence of the style that made Sheen one of the first popular radio and television preachers as well as a best-selling author. The collection will certainly appeal to those who remember him and were part of his audience. It may serve the publisher's purpose of introducing Sheen to a new generation. It will, in any case, serve as a fitting centennial celebration of one of the most important shapers of popular religious thought in the twentieth century. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>The Shrine</h2><p>Alice, a deaf-mute, has a vision of a lady in white who says she is the immaculate conception.

After Alice is visited by an apparition, she is suddenly cured and works her own miracles. Narrator Sean Barrett splendidly presents the best and worst in people who are influenced by the "miracle." Each transition between characters and situations is perfectly translated by Barrett's controlled delivery. Particularly moving is the death of a beloved priest. Also, the weather and atmosphere become important characters as the story unfolds, and innocence and evil become one. Barrett's performance could hardly be more compelling.

Men's movement guru Sam Keen examines peanut butter as a metaphor for story because he continues to have a taste for it, despite the fact that other adults feel they have outgrown it; he also claims controversially that mythology is ethnically specific and that non-Native Americans "will not find our animating stories in Native American myths." Edith Sullwold explores dreams as personal record and highlights their cryptic nature by relating how Jung himself admitted being unable to interpret his own dreams. Richard Lewis believes that "the television set has become a substitute storyteller," and John L.

In Drones and the Ethics of Targeted Killing, ethicist Kenneth R. Himes provides not only an overview of the role of drones in national security but also an important exploration of the ethical implications of drone warfare&#x2014;from the impact on terrorist organizations and civilians to how piloting drones shapes soldiers.<br><br>Targeted killings have played a role in politics from ancient times through today, so the ethical challenges around how to protect against threats are not new. Himes leads readers through the ethics of targeted killings in history from ancient times to the contemporary Israeli-Palestinian conflict, then looks specifically at the new issues raised through the use of drones. This book is a powerful look at a pressing topic today.</p><p>Kenneth R. Himes, OFM, is associate professor of moral theology at Boston College. He is the author or coeditor of several books, including Christianity and the Political Order, Modern Catholic Social Teaching, and Responses to 101 Questions on Catholic Social Teaching. He regularly contributes to publications such as America and Theological Studies.No single book can do everything, of course, and this one achieves much. Himes shakes readers awake to some of the most pressing issues surrounding drones and the ethics of targeted killing today. (<i>Studies in Christian Ethics</i>)<br><br>Ken Himes' latest book, Drones and the Ethics of Targeted Killing...represents what I hope will be the first of many steps toward re-shaping the discussion of the ethics, legality, and wisdom of contemporary military operations. . . .I recommend the book...because Himes is asking all the right questions. In the hard ethical work that lies before us, Drones and the Ethics of Targeted Killing represents a necessary and timely contribution. (<i>Journal of Military Ethics</i>)<br><br>Kenneth Himes has provided a balanced, well-researched, and readable guide to the issues. His central purpose is to bring just war theory to bear on the targeting of individuals who are not on active battlefields. An associate professor of theology at Boston College, Himes dedicates the book to the students he&#x2019;s taught over the years, and that is fitting: it is the sort of book one would expect from a fair and dedicated teacher because it explains complex topics clearly and presents both sides of fraught moral debates. (<i>The Christian Century</i>)<br><br>In grappling so prudently with the ethics of new technologies that intersect with very old moral quandaries regarding the justification of targeted killing, H[imes] produces a veritable masterpiece of ethical analysis. . . .In meeting the challenge of adapting established principles to new global conditions that may alter our evaluation of the use of force, it is hard to imagine a more insightful guide than H[imes]. (<i>Theological Studies</i>)<br><br>The chapters taken individually on the Christian tradition, the use of the just war tradition in public debate, US government policy in favour of drone use and ethical reflections on the US government&#x2019;s use of drones each stand alone as solid introductions to their respective fields of enquiry. (<i>Theology</i>)<br><br>Himes&#x2019; approach is well organized, well researched, and clear. . . .Himes consistently asks and pursues the right questions. His book belongs in college libraries and on course syllabi. (<i>Horizons: The Journal of the College Theology Society</i>)<br><br>Himes has written a broadly designed, strategically precise, and morally insightful analysis of two major issues in U.S. policy: targeted killings and drones. Both topics yield intense debate in the United States and around the world; the intensity of the debate at times obscures the issues or fails to provide sufficient breadth of analysis. Himes&#x2019;s work provides a remedy. Two principal characteristics of this work are its lucidity and fairness in addressing contested questions. Himes draws in detail on technical and strategic literature and combines this with moral and legal analysis. While much of the book is focused on the wars since 9-11, Himes recognizes that both of his topics will extend into the future because of the nature of contemporary conflicts. The book deserves a wide audience and is guaranteed a long shelf life. (J. Bryan Hehir, Parker Gilbert Montgomery Professor of the Practice of Religion and Public Life, Harvard Kennedy School of Government)<br><br>The ethics of war is often accused of neither anticipating future fighting technologies nor keeping up with current developments in arms and tactics. Although I wish this book had been around at least a decade ago, it is definitely better a tad late than never! With Drones and the Ethics of Targeted Killing, Kenneth R. Himes provides the most up-to-date and thorough treatment of drones and their use for targeted killings. The book displays historical breadth&#x2014;probing the ethics of various types of targeted killing, including tyrannicide and assassination&#x2014;from the ancient world to the present day. It also possesses depth&#x2014;exploring the nature and use of drones, with particular and detailed attention given to Israel and the Intifada and the U.S. policy of using drones in its war against terrorists. For anyone interested in a careful moral evaluation, offered by one of today's leading ethicists, of drone usage as a kind of targeted killing, this is a must-read. (Tobias Winright, Hubert M�der Chair of Health Care Ethics, Saint Louis University)<br><br>In his analysis of the emerging discourse of targeted killing, Kenneth R. Himes carefully examines the blurring of categories traditionally used for the justification of political killings&#x2014;the paradigm of law enforcement and the just war tradition. This book will serve as an important source for anybody interested in the history and political-ethical context of killing in the political sphere. (Hille Haker, Richard A.

They&#x2019;re just classic &#x201c;domestic&#x201d; novels about marriage, motherhood, and modern upper-middle-class family life, after all. And despite the fact that <em>Big Little Lies</em> is Moriarty&#x2019;s sixth adult novel (and it comes decades after the grandmother of this kind of thing, <em>Bridget Jones&#x2019; Diary</em>), it is remarkably new and fresh and winning Set in an Australian suburb, <em>Big Little Lies</em> focuses on three women, all of whom have children at the same preschool. One is a great beauty married to a fabulously rich businessman; they have a &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; set of twins. One is the can-do mom who can put together a mean pre-school art project but can&#x2019;t prevent her teenage daughter from preferring her divorced dad. The third is a withdrawn, single mother who doesn&#x2019;t quite fit in. Right from the start--thanks to a modern &#x201c;Greek chorus&#x201d; that narrates the action--we know that someone is going to end up dead. The questions are who and how. Miraculously, Moriarty keeps this high concept plot aloft, largely because she infuses it with such wit and heart. She also knows not to overplay the message she&#x2019;s sending: that we all tell lies--to each other and, more importantly, to ourselves. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p><b>Liane Moriarty</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Truly Madly Guilty</i>, <i>Big Little Lies</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Husband&#x2019;s Secret</i>, <i>The Hypnotist&#x2019;s Love Story</i>, and <i>What Alice Forgot</i>.

She also shows how you can incorporate this rich tradition into your own life, through meditations, mantras and chanting.<br></p><p>Bodhisattva means "enlightenment being" in Sanskrit i.e., one who is ready to pass over into nirvana and merge into oneness with the universe. The bodhisattva, however, postpones nirvana out of compassion for others, vowing to help them until they are able to make the journey. Like Christian saints, bodhisattvas mediate between human and divine realms; they often work miracles, and much like patron saints they have areas of special interest or competence. A mostly legendary figure regarded as a protector of children and the weak as well as a healer, Jizo Bodhisattva is widely revered. Bays, a pediatrician specializing in child-abuse prevention and a Zen priest who heads the Larch Mountain Zen Center in Oregon, presents a clear and intelligent portrait of Jizo. Displaying a gift for communicating emotions, she also shares how that figure has affected her personal experiences with children and helped her deal with collective pain. This book will appeal to both casual readers and specialists in public and academic libraries, especially those with substantial religion collections. James F.

He is the author of Unionist-Nationalism: Governing Urban Scotland, 1830-1860 (Tuckwell Press, 1999), Locality, Community and Nation (Hodder and Stoughton, 1998) and a number of articles and essays in journals and edited volumes. He is also an occasional contributor to press and radio on matters to do with Scottish nationalism. He lives in Kirkcaldy, Fife."The Wallace story is part of Scotland's imagined community.... We can't break the story because there is no story." In this densely written scholarly study, the author, a professor at Edinburgh University, examines the legends that have surrounded the exploits of William Wallace (1274-1305). Wallace is credited with liberating Scotland by defeating the English at Stirling Bridge (1297); his stature as the savior of Scotland has been reinforced by the recent film Braveheart. Later Wallace was vanquished by Edward I of England at Falkirk (1298). He lived as an outlaw and guerilla fighter until he was betrayed to the English, tried and bloodily executed in 1305. The author researched the very slim historical sources available and found problems with corroborating evidence. Much of Wallace's early reputation, for example, rested on the verse of "blind Harry," who wrote in the late 15th century. According to Morton, Harry's poetry has been romanticized and is almost certainly filled with errors. Ballads, songs and biographies of later centuries extolling Wallace's heroism are based on patriotism rather than truth. Morton also investigates how the myth of Wallace served both Scottish nationalism and socialism. In recent years the Wallace cult has grown, due to video games and Web sites. Although the author does not argue for completely abandoning national myths that cannot be proven, his hope for the Wallace mystique is that it is time to "lay his ghost to rest." <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Tea With Mr Rochester</h2><p>From the front flap of this 178 page book: &#34;Snatches of a Beethoven quartet would come floating intermittently to Simon reading at a respectful distance, to Etta going about in gardening gloves and a large straw hat such as French cows wear, to Mrs. Prideaux laying flowers in a shallow basket, passing from bed to bed with a pair of secateurs. In a cool green dress with corals in her ears, she would descend on them, with that look on her face as of returning from another world, and be silent and distraite, so that both Simon and Etta were made to feel themselves in the presence of a superior being. Only Mrs. Prideaux entertained the angel unawares. &#39;I always think the very nicest thing one can have for tea is cucumber sandwiches,&#39; she would say. &#39;Heavenly,&#39; said Sandra, absentmindedly helping herself to yet another. she ate a great many of them and somehow made the act poetical, reminding Simon of a roe or a young bat feeding among the lilies.&#34; And from the rear flap: &#34;Frances Towers, born in Calcutta in 1885, was the eldest of five children of a British Government telegraph engineer. She went to school in Bedford from the age of nine and between 1905-31 worked at the Bank of England, as a clerk and then as Assistant to the Supervisor. She wrote articles and entered literary competitions and spent her holidays abroad indulging her passions for Gothic architecture, Old Masters and mountains; her first short story was published in 1929. During the late 1930s &#39;Miss Fay&#39;, as she was known to her pupils, began teaching English and History at Southlands School, Harrow, where her sister was headmistress. Most of Frances Towers&#39; short stories were written during the late 1940s, but she died suddenly of pneumonia on New Year&#39;s Day, 1948, the year before publication of her only book &#39;Tea with Mr. Rochester.&#39;&#34;</p><p></p><h2>GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES: THE ILLUMINATING DIARY OF A PROFESSIONAL LADY (PICADOR)</h2><p>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady</p><p></p><h2>Knitting Goes Large: 20 Designs to Flatter Your Figure</h2><p><p>Trying to find great knit designs in larger sizes is not always easy. <i>Knitting Goes Large</i> aims to fill the gap by offering a selection of 20 great knits for all occasions and all seasons for larger women with varying figure types.

Growing up in suburban Maryland, Wisconsin's "Big Woods" seemed a far-distant and amazing place! I was fascinated by the people and adventures I discovered within the pages of each book in the series. Little did I know that one day I would move permanently to Wisconsin.<br><br>I never lost my soft spot for the Little House books, and was delighted to find that re-reading them as an adult brought new levels of understanding to Wilder's pioneer experiences. My older sister and I have visited each homesite devoted to the famous author, and I've known for some time that Chloe and her sister Kari needed to do the same. After finishing the previous Chloe mystery, <i>Tradition of Deceit</i>, the time was right. <br><br>In <i>Death on the Prairie</i>, Chloe and Kari embark on an epic road trip tour to each of Laura's homesites. Their visits, of course, do not go as smoothly as mine! I hope you enjoy their adventures--and if you're a Little House fan, I hope the book evokes some happy memories.<b>Kathleen Ernst</b> is an award-winning and bestselling author, educator, and social historian.

Henry&#39;s tyrannical, brick laying father, Nick, though weak and alcoholic, can still strike fear into the hearts of his sons. His mother, though ill and devout to her Catholicism, still has the power to comfort and confuse her children. This is typical of Fante&#39;s novels, it&#39;s autobiographical, and brimming with love, death, violence and religion. Writing with great passion Fante powerfully hits home the damage family can wreck upon us all.</p><p>Born in Denver on 8 April 1909, John Fante migrated to Los Angeles in his early twenties. Classically out of place in a town built on celluloid dreams, Fante&#39;s literary fiction was full of torn grace and redemptive vengeance. Wait Until Spring, Bandini (1938), his first novel, began the saga of Arturo Bandini, a character whose story continues in The Road to Los Angeles, Ask the Dust and Dreams from Bunker Hill - collectively known as The Bandini Quartet. Fante published several other novels, as well as stories, novellas and screenplays in his seventy-four years, including The Brotherhood of the Grape (1977) and 1933 Was A Bad Year (posthumously, 1985). He was posthumously recognised in 1987 with a Lifetime Achievement Award by PEN in Los Angeles, four years after his death from diabetes-related complications.Fante's searing, effortless style eschewed the refinement of Fitzgerald, the hubris of Hemingway and the panoramic vistas of Dos Passos. Instead he marshalled the raw materials of his own life - poverty, sex, paternal hatred, Catholic guilt, misplaced pride, hard drinking, labour, fighting, overarching literary ambition and the internecine hatred within immigrant communities in pre-war America - rendering the pain and comedy with such heartbreaking simplicity as to brook no hint of the literary zeitgeist. * * Dazed &amp; Confused * * John Fante takes some beating . . . mean, moody, disturbing and intensely atmospheric. * * The Times * * John Fante knew how to make words sing. When he was on form, he could write sentences that stopped time. * * Uncut * * Bandini is a magnificent creation, and his rediscovery is not before time. * * Times Literary Supplement * * Fante was my God. -- Charles Bukowski</p><h2>Seven Ancient Wonders</h2><p>Book by Matthew Reilly</p><p>Mathew Reilly's <i>7 Deadly Wonders</i> is a lot of things--fast-paced, clever, action-packed. But mostly it's perfect for a Jerry Bruckheimer treatment. The novel reads like a screenplay meets video game with one harrowing chase after another.<p> The breakneck action stems from an Egyptian sun cult which has hidden pieces of the capstone to the great pyramid in the husks of the seven wonders of ancient world, leaving clues that would flummox Indiana Jones. Here's the deal: whichever nation can locate and assemble the capstone in time for a cosmic event designed to end life on Earth will rule the world. Enter a ragtag team of commandos representing non-superpowers (read, in a <i>Da Vinci Code</i> context, not the European Union, the United States or the Vatican) who stand to lose in this eventuality. The team pits itself in a race against the formidable forces of the western world, cosmic calendar, and traps set by ancient-wonder-hider, Imhotep V. Complete with Mario-Brothers-style drawings, the book lurches from one great escape/victory/defeat until its final climax atop Cheops' Pyramid. It's a thrilling ride, perfect to enliven a lazy vacation or long plane ride.

She knew it was her own fault, because she had reached inside her purse to get a tissue and forgotten to close the zipper, so all the thief had to do was slip his or her hand inside and remove her wallet. One MasterCard, one American Express gone, as well as most of her money. At least she'd had sense enough to put a hundred and fifty dollars in her carryon, so she wasn't destitute.<br><br>After she discovered the theft, she had the brand-new learning experience of canceling her credit cards. To Samantha everything that had happened was traumatic: coming to the big, bad city of New York for the first time, being welcomed by a pickpocket, and having to cancel her charge cards. To the bored young woman behind the claims counter, these were all things that happened fifty times a day. Handing Samantha forms to fill out, she pointed to a wall chart with the credit card companies' telephone numbers on them and told her to call them. While Samantha was on the telephone, the woman managed to crack her gum, polish her nails, talk to her boyfriend on the phone, and tell her colleague what she wanted for lunch, all at the same time. Samantha tried to tell the young woman about her lost wallet, tried to tell her that the wallet had belonged to her mother and had a leather lining printed with what her father had called a psychedelic design. But the woman gave Samantha a blank look and said,"Yeah, sure." If the woman hadn't just demonstrated that she had enough intelligence to do several tasks at the same time, Samantha would have thought from the blank expression in her eyes that she was terminally stupid.<br><br>By the time Samantha got away from the lost articles department, her suitcase had been locked into a glass-fronted room and she had to find a guard to open it -- no mean feat, because no one she spoke to knew who had the key to the room. In fact, no one seemed to know the locked room even existed.<br><br>By the time she got her suitcase, pulling it along behind her on a wheeled cart, her carryon slung over her shoulder, she was shaking with exhaustion and frustration.<br><br>Now all she had to do was get a taxi, the first taxi she had ridden in in her life, and get into the city.<br><br>Thirty minutes later, she was inside the dirtiest automobile she had ever seen. It stunk of cigarette smoke so strongly she thought she might be sick, but when she tried to roll down the window, she found that both of the inside handles of the doors were missing. She would have spoken to the driver, but his name on the paper under the meter seemed to be spelled mostly with x's and k's, and he didn't seem to speak much English.<br><br>Looking out the dirty window of the cab, trying not to breathe, she attempted the impossible task of not thinking of anything at all, not where she was, why she was there, or how long she was going to have to stay.<br><br>The cab drove under a bridge that looked as though it should have been condemned, then down streets filled on both sides with tiny, dirty-windowed shops. When the driver asked for the address for the third time, Samantha gave it to him yet again, trying not to relay her frustration to him. The paper her father's attorney had given her said the apartment was in a brownstone, located in the East Sixties, between Park and Lexington.<br><br>When the driver slowed, looking for the address, she was on a street that seemed quieter and less cluttered than the other areas they had driven through. After the cab stopped, she paid the driver, quickly tried to calculate the tip, then removed her two bags without his help from the floor of the car.<br><br>Looking up at the building in front of her, she saw a five-story house that was only two windows wide. It was a very pretty town house, with a tall staircase leading up to a door with a fanlight over it. A wisteria vine growing up the left side of the house all the way to the roof was covered with purple buds just about to burst into bloom.<br><br>Samantha pushed the doorbell, then waited. There was no answer. Even after three rings and fifteen minutes, there still was no answer.<br><br>"Of course," she said, sitting down on her suitcase. What had she expected? That the landlord would be there to give her a key to the outside door? Just because she had written him and informed him of her arrival time didn't mean he should bother himself to be there to open the door for her. What did it matter to him that she wanted a shower and to sit down on something that wasn't moving?<br><br>As she sat on her suitcase waiting for the man, wondering if he was going to show up at all, she speculated about what she would do in a city the size of New York with no place to stay. Could she take a taxi to a hotel and spend the night there? Could she get her father's attorney to wire her more money until she could open a bank account in New York?<br><br>Several more minutes went by, but no one came, nor did any of the passersby seem to notice her. A couple of men smiled at her, but she pointedly looked away.<br><br>While Samantha was sitting at the top of the stairs, she looked to the side and noticed that at ground level was another door into the house. Maybe that was the front door of the house and she was to knock there.<br><br>Not knowing whether it was safe or not to leave her bags on the top of the stoop, she decided to leave them and pray they weren't stolen. Going down the stairs and around them to the ground floor door, she walked around a pretty wrought-iron spike-tipped fence and knocked several times, but there was no answer.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, her fists clenched, she looked back up at her suitcases sitting safely at the top of the stairs. Beside the ground floor door was a box of red geraniums, and the sight of the flowers made her smile. At least the flowers seemed happy: They were well cared for, not a dead leaf was on them, the soil was moist but not wet, and the flowers were heavy with bloom.<br><br>Still smiling, she started toward the stairs, but just as she rounded the corner, a football came whizzing so close over her head that she ducked. When the flying football was followed by what looked to be a couple hundred pounds of male clad in denim shorts and a sweat shirt with both armholes torn out to the waist, Samantha moved to slam herself flat against the wall of the stairs.<br><br>At least she tried to get out of the way of the man, but she wasn't fast enough. He caught the football as it sailed over her head, then, startled, he saw her just as he was about to land on her. At the same time that he released the ball, he reached out to catch Samantha before she fell against the spikes of the fence.<br><br>Giving a little gasp as she nearly fell, his hands caught her and pulled her to him in a protective way.<br><br>For a moment she stood encircled by his arms. He was taller than her five foot four, probably just at six feet, but the protective way he bent toward her made them almost eye level with each other. They were nearly isolated, with, the tall stairs behind them, the next house's stairs not far in front of them, the fence and flower box nearby. Samantha started to say thank you to the man, but as she looked at him, she forgot what she was going to say.<br><br>He was an extraordinarily good-looking man, with black, curling hair, heavy black brows, and dark eyes with eyelashes any female would kill for, all atop a full-lipped mouth that looked as though it belonged on a sculpture by Michelangelo. He might have looked feminine if his nose hadn't been broken a couple of times and he didn't have three days' growth of black whiskers on his chin and if his finely sculpted head weren't sitting on top of a body that bulged with muscle. No, he didn't look feminine. All the eyelashes in the world couldn't make this man look less than one hundred percent male. In fact, maleness oozed from him, making Samantha feel small and helpless, as though she were wearing yards of lavender lace. He even smelled male, not the artificial smell that could be purchased in a store; this man smelled of pure male sweat, a little beer, and acres of bronzed skin warmed by sun and exercise.<br><br>But it was the man's mouth that fascinated her. He had the most beautiful mouth she'd ever seen on a human being. It was full and sculptured, looking both hard and soft at the same time, and she couldn't take her eyes off of it. When she saw those lips moving toward her own, she didn't move away. He placed his lips on hers, softly at first, as though asking permission. Samantha, reacting to instinct and need and to something even more basic, opened her mouth slightly under his, and he pressed closer. Had her life depended on it, she couldn't have moved her lips away from his warm, sweet mouth, but when she put her hand up in half-hearted protest, she came in contact with his shoulder. It had been a long time since she had felt male skin near her own. And she had never felt a shoulder such as this one. Hard, firm muscle rounded over the top of his arm, and Samantha's hand curved over the muscle, her fingers digging into the resilient flesh.<br><br>When her hand closed over his arm, he leaned closer, his big, hard, heavy body pressing against hers, pinning her close to the wall. Samantha's hand slipped to his back, slipped under his open-sided shirt and met with the contours of the muscle on his back.<br><br>A moan escaping her lips, her body began to sink into his.<br><br>Putting one big hand behind her head, he turned her to the side and began to kiss her with all the passion she had missed in her life. He kissed her the way she had always wanted to be kissed, had dreamed of being kissed, kissed her the way fairy tales are supposed to end, the way all the books say a kiss should feel -- the way no one had ever kissed her before.<br><br>As he moved one of his big, muscular thighs between her much smaller ones, Samantha's arms went fully around his neck, pulling him closer, pulling him as close as he could come to her.<br><br>Moving his mouth away from hers, he kissed her neck, kissed her ear lobe as his hands moved down her back. Cupping her buttocks in his hands, he moved her so most of her weight was on his thigh, then ran one hand down the length of her leg and lifted it, settling her ankle about his waist.<br><br>"Hey Mike, you're drawin' a crowd.<br><br>At first Samantha didn't hear the voice, didn't hear anything; she only felt.<br><br>It w...as the man who broke away. Pulling his lips from her skin, he put his hand to her cheek, caressing her cheek with his thumb while looking into her eyes, smiling at her.<br><br>"Hey, Mike, this your long-lost cousin or somebody you picked up on the street?"<br>0 <br><br>Leaning forward, the man gave Samantha one more soft kiss then took her ankle from his waist and held her hand.<br><br>It was when he moved away from her that Samantha began to think again. And the first emotion she felt was horror, absolute, sheer horror at what she had done. She tried to snatch her hand from the man's grasp, but he held her fast.<br><br>There were three sweaty men who looked as though they wore their cigarettes rolled up in their T-shirt sleeves and drank beer for breakfast standing in front of them, all with leers on their faces, all with smirking expressions, as though they knew something they weren't supposed to know. "You gonna introduce us or not?"<br><br>"Sure," the man said, holding onto Samantha's hand in spite of her tugs as he pulled her forward. "I'd like you to meet..." Turning, he looked at her in question.<br><br>Samantha looked away from him; she didn't want to look in his face again. No mirror was needed to tell her that her own face was brilliant red with embarrassment. "Samantha Elliot," she managed to whisper.<br><br>"Oh, yeah?" the man holding her hand said, then looked back at the three men, who were now nudging each other at this new knowledge that Mike didn't know the woman he had moments before been kissing as though he meant to swallow her whole.<br><br>"I'd like you to meet my tenant," the man said with a grin. "She's going to be living in my house with me." The pride and delight in his voice came through clearly.<br><br>Giving a sharp jerk on her hand, Samantha freed herself from his grip. She would have thought her mortification could not deepen, but at the realization of who this man was, it did. Horror, humiliation, panic, revulsion were all emotions that crowded into her, and she wanted to flee. Or die. Or preferably both.<br><br>"Some roommate!" Laughing in a vulgar way, one of the men looked her up and down.<br><br>"You wanta live with me, baby, just let me know," the second man said.<br><br>"With you <i>and</i> your wife," the third man said, hitting the second one in the ribs. "Honey, I'm not married. I'll take real good care of you. Better than Mike would -- or could."<br><br>"Get out of here!" Mike yelled back good-naturedly, no animosity in his voice, just good humor as he picked up the football and tossed it to them.<br><br>One of the men caught the ball, and the three of them went down the street, punching each other and laughing as they walked.<br><br>The man turned to her. "I'm Mike." Putting out his hand to shake, he didn't seem to understand when Samantha only stared at him. "Michael Taggert." When she still didn't respond, he began to explain. "Your landlord. You wrote me a letter, remember?"<br><br>Not saying a word, Samantha walked past him, careful not to touch him, and went up the stairs. Her luggage was in her hands before he was beside her.<br><br>"Wait a minute while I open the door. I hope the apartment's all right for you. I had a crew come in and clean the place and put clean sheets on your bed. I'm sorry I wasn't here when you arrived, but I lost track of the time and -- Hey! Where are you going?"<br><br>A suitcase in, each hand, Samantha had gone down the stairs and was three houses down the block by the time he got the door unlocked.<br><br>Bounding down the stairs two at a time, Mike came to a stop in front of her and reached out to take her bags, but she jerked them away from him, trying to walk around him, but he wouldn't let her pass.<br><br>pard<br> <br>"You're not mad because I was late, are you?"<br><br>Giving him a quick, hard glare, Samantha again tried to move around him. After three pivots and his blocking of every one of them, she turned and started walking in the other direction, but he blocked her that way too. Finally, she stopped and glared at him. "Would you please let me pass?"<br><br>"I don't, understand," he said. "Where are you going?"<br><br>Intelligent stupid people, she thought. Was this city full of them? Still glaring at him, she said,"Mr. Taggert, I am going to find a hotel."<br><br>"A hotel? But I have your apartment ready for you. You haven't even seen it yet, so you can't dislike it. It's not me, is it? I told you I was sorry I was late. I'm not usually late, but my watch got wet last week and it's in the shop and I couldn't tell what time it was. And those bozos I was with probably couldn't tell time if they had a watch and could figure out how to buckle it on."<br><br>Giving him a look that was meant to wither him on the spot, Samantha moved around him.<br><br>He wasn't to be put off so easily as he stepped back in front of her and started walking backward. "It's the guys, isn't it? Pretty crude, aren't they? I apologize for them. I only see them when I want to toss a ball around with someone and at the gym. I mean, I don't see them socially, if that's what's worrying you. You won't have to see them in our house. I promise."<br><br>Halting for a moment, Samantha had to marvel at the man. How could he be so very beautiful and understand so very little? She forced herself to look away ...</p><h2>The One Year Bible for New Believers NLT</h2><p>Whether you're discovering a new passion for the Bible or you're reading it for the first time, <i>The One Year Bible for New Believers</i> is perfect for you.

After a long recovery period during which she loses the small amount of residual hearing she had seemed to retain, Gustie tries to pick up the pieces of her life. Her parents are unrealistic and overprotective; her best friend rejects her; her teachers run the gamut from being convinced that Gustie cannot function in the mainstream to being supportive. While the characters are a bit stereotypical, each serves a purpose in furthering the plot, during which Gustie passes through her own stages of denial and anger and comes at last to acceptance of her new self. Through a new boyfriend who has a deaf brother and sister-in-law, and through Gustie's visit with an understanding special education teacher to a class of predominantly congenitally deaf students, readers are made aware of the tremendous range of difference among deaf and hard of hearing people, the ways in which they communicate and the technical aids available to them. Realistic and involving, this story compares favorable to Corcoran's A Dance to Still Music (Atheneum, 1974). YAs will identify with Gustie and her wish to belong; the book should touch them and be popular. Ruth A.

It is a companion volume to Ketchum's American Redware (Holt, 1991), which it resembles in coverage and format. The author has made a good synthesis of many regional studies of folk pottery. After an informative introductory section describing types of stoneware products, he summarizes the stoneware production of states and regions in a well-balanced but somewhat cursory treatment of individual potters. The illustrations are all excellent color photographs showing good examples of the stoneware potters' craft.

Thom believed that both the ability and the inspiration to create his paintings had been given to him as a gift. His goal as an artist was to touch people of all faiths and to bring peace and joy into their lives through the images he created.<br><br><b>Katherine Spencer</b> was a fiction editor before turning to a full-time career as a writer. The author of more than thirty books, she also writes the Angel Island series, as well as the Black Sheep Knitting Mysteries under her real name, Anne Canadeo. She lives with her husband and daughter in a small village on the Long Island Sound. Outside of her office, she is active in many community charity projects.Billed as the Painter of Light, Kinkade claims to be "the most collected living artist" and the heir apparent to Norman Rockwell. This sugarcoated modern fairy tale reflects the pastel-tinted idealism of Kinkade's paintings and is clearly intended to extol the power of prayer as put forth by Protestant Christian doctrines. Taking temporary leave of her Boston bank job, 32-year-old Jessica Warwick returns home to the idyllic nearby village of Cape Light to help her older sister, Emily, the town's mayor, care for their domineering mother, who has suffered a stroke. Thinking of her budding romance with sophisticated Paul Copperfield, an older career-oriented man, Jessica is counting the days until her mother recovers sufficiently so she can leave this prosaic, Bible-thumping town and return to her job in the city. Outside of the church, the quotidian life of the community centers around the Clam Box, a local eatery operated by Charlie and Lucy Bates. Charlie, a vocal critic of Emily's leadership, is mounting a campaign to oppose her in the upcoming election. Unbeknownst to Emily, Sara Franklin, the college girl waiting tables at the Clam Box, is the daughter she gave up for adoption two decades ago, following her husband's tragic death. Meanwhile, Jessica finds herself falling for Sam Morgan, the town's jack-of-all-trades. As Jessica's growing attraction to churchgoing Sam conflicts with her career-oriented dreams, the plot sags under a surfeit of trite, blatantly proselytizing Christian subplots and syrupy sentimentality.

Using personal stories from his own life as a student athlete in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and as shortstop for the Yankees, Derek writes about how anyone can achieve his or her dreams by following some simple steps, such as setting your goals high, finding the right role models, being serious but having fun, thinking before you act, surrounding yourself with a strong supporting cast, and much more. <br><br>Filled with anecdotes and fully illustrated with never-before-published family photos and pictures of Derek playing for the Yankees, <b>The Life You Imagine</b> is an intimate look into the life of a superstar athlete. Derek talks openly about the remarkable relationship he has with his family and how they raised him to be hardworking, tenacious, and respectful of authority. He also shares details about what it was like growing up in an interracial family and how this helped define who he is. And he shares plenty of stories about the Yankees and baseball, too -- his training program, his batting and fielding techniques, what it was like to play on three World Series Championship teams, and how he's used his baseball celebrity to found the Turn 2 Foundation, which helps promote a healthy lifestyle for kids through drug and alcohol prevention programs. <br><br>"I always wanted this to happen, every at bat, every inning, every amazing experience that I've had so far. I always wanted to play baseball in the major leagues, praying that the Yankees would be the team that drafted me. I wanted to win World Series Championships and wake up every morning knowing that I loved my job."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Derek Jeter</p><p>Derek Jeter is the starting shortstop for the New York Yankees and is the founder of the Turn 2 Foundation. He divides his time between Tampa, Florida, and New York City.<br><br>Jack Curry is a baseball columnist and reporter for the <i>New York Times</i>. He lives with his wife in New Jersey.I was about eight years old as I walked along our thick carpet, past the pictures of my grandparents on the hallway walls and into my parents' bedroom. I announced that I was going to play for the Yankees. They were already in their pajamas, but they patiently listened to what their skinny son with the wavy brown hair and green eyes had said, and then told me the type of thing I was aching to hear. They told me that I could do anything I wanted in life if I worked hard enough and stayed dedicated to it, which was like offering me season tickets. Forget about lounging in the box seats, because, in my mind, I was heading straight for the dugout. Before I was nine years old.<br><br>My parents could have gently put me off and told me to go to sleep that night, but instead were receptive to my dream and talked about what it would take to achieve such a difficult goal. They sat me on the edge of the bed and told me that if I was serious about being a professional baseball player, I had to realize I wouldn't just be competing against players from Kalamazoo or from Michigan, but against players from all over the world. Everyone in the Westwood Little League where I played wanted to be a major leaguer, my mother and father emphasized. The competition to be good enough to make it to the majors will be ferocious, they told me. But I didn't blink. I didn't focus on that right away. I had a dream and I was ecstatic, because they didn't say it couldn't be done -- just that it would be tough to accomplish this goal.<br><br>I used to imitate announcers doing play-by-play, with me as the star, of course. "Deep to left," I'd bellow, "and that ball is gone! Jeter has done it again!" I probably weighed 70 pounds with two rolls of quarters in my pockets when I was eight, so the idea of me hitting a ball 420 feet someday was just a dream. When all of my questions about being a Yankee were exhausted that night, my parents told me it was time to go to sleep. I went to bed, clinging to the blanket and to my dream. My dream remained with me, from the time I was eight until the time I was 18, and it stays with me now. It never left. It got stronger. It kept pushing me to get exactly where I am today.<br><br>I think we should all set goals in life and set them high. I did that, and my parents encouraged me to do it, which is one of the main reasons I am where I am today. I had a vision about playing baseball, and my parents used that positive vision to establish guidelines that would enable me to grow as a person while I pursued my dream. From setting high goals to dealing with growing pains, to surrounding myself with trustworthy friends, to understanding that the world can be an unfair place, to obeying and loving my parents, to thinking before I acted, I was learning about life while I was yearning to be a Yankee. <br><br>But it all starts with setting goals -- we all need them. Whether your goal is to play for the Yankees or to win the pie-eating contest at summer camp, goals are what motivate us to do better. My ultimate dream was to play major-league baseball, but I had smaller goals along the way. No matter how elated I was on that night in my parents' bedroom, I wasn't going to be a major leaguer at the age of nine. I chased my dream through smaller goals. Making the Little League All-Star Team, starting on the high school varsity as a freshman, making all-district, making all-state, and so on, until I eventually wound up at shortstop for the Yankees. But, believe me, there were dozens, even hundreds, of small goals that led me to the point where I finally became a Yankee.<br><br>We all have to start somewhere. Think about it. What do you love to do? What are you good at? What is something you would like to do for the rest of your life? These are important and serious questions, questions that you might not feel like answering before you graduate from high school. Some people even get to college, or after, and still can't answer them. But you really should think about them as soon as possible, because when you find that interest, that goal that excites you like nothing else, you'll want to open your bedroom window and yell it to anyone with ears: Guess what I'm going to do with my life!<br><br>A feeling will envelop you and you'll treat that goal like it is the most important thing in the world, acting the same passionate way I used to act about baseball. No matter who asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I told them I was going to play baseball and I was going to play for the Yankees. I was so confident in my abilities and so consumed with my dream that I wanted to shout out my intentions.<br><br>If you don't set goals, you're not going to have dreams, either. The goals are the achievements along the way to get you to your dreams. Dreams don't just happen, and you're not going to make your pursuit easier by being lazy about it. The longer you wait to decide what you want to do, the more time you're wasting. It's up to you to want to do something so badly that your passion shows in your actions. Your actions, not your words, will do the shouting for you. People will see how devoted and prepared you are as the captain of the debate team, and they might say, "One day, that kid is going to be a great lawyer."<br><br>Once you've set goals and pondered what kind of dream you want those goals to lead to, it's extremely helpful to have someone who can support you. It might be your parents, a sibling, a teacher, or a friend, but we all need somebody who is going to be there to prop us up when things aren't going well and to keep us levelheaded when things are going very well.

The other two writings are the &#x201e;Gheranda Samhita&#x201c; and &#x201e;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&#x201c;, which are also partially immersed in the tantric system of exercise, but the &#x201e;Shiva Samhita&#x201c; has its origin in the tantric system and is, therefore, a hermetic Indian fundamental work. The Hindu god Shiva communicated the text in a conversation with his wife Parvati, which points to this form of Shastras (scripts). The &#x201e;Shiva Samhita&#x201c; is considered the most comprehensive and step-by-step treatise on yoga. All subsequent works on yoga are based on this book, although few people mention it. The &#x201e;Shiva Samhita&#x201c; talks about the complex physiology of yoga, of 84 different asanas (of which only four are described more precisely and are hermetically correct), describes five specific types of Prana &#x2013; which are subordinate to the 5 deeds &#x2013; and provides techniques to master them. It also deals with abstract yoga philosophy, mudras, tantric practices, and meditation. The &#x201e;Shiva Samhita&#x201c; emphasizes that even an ordinary individual can practice yoga and benefit from it, in the spirit of Franz Bardon!</p><p></p><h2>Moral Minority: The Evangelical Left in an Age of Conservatism (Politics and Culture in Modern America)</h2><p><p>In 1973, nearly a decade before the height of the Moral Majority, a group of progressive activists assembled in a Chicago YMCA to strategize about how to move the nation in a more evangelical direction through political action. When they emerged, the <i>Washington Post</i> predicted that the new evangelical left could "shake both political and religious life in America." The following decades proved the <i>Post</i> both right and wrong&#x2014;evangelical participation in the political sphere was intensifying, but in the end it was the religious right, not the left, that built a viable movement and mobilized electorally. How did the evangelical right gain a moral monopoly and why were evangelical progressives, who had shown such promise, left behind?</p><p>In <i>Moral Minority</i>, the first comprehensive history of the evangelical left, David R. Swartz sets out to answer these questions, charting the rise, decline, and political legacy of this forgotten movement. Though vibrant in the late nineteenth century, progressive evangelicals were in eclipse following religious controversies of the early twentieth century, only to reemerge in the 1960s and 1970s. They stood for antiwar, civil rights, and anticonsumer principles, even as they stressed doctrinal and sexual fidelity. Politically progressive and theologically conservative, the evangelical left was also remarkably diverse, encompassing groups such as Sojourners, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Evangelicals for Social Action, and the Association for Public Justice. Swartz chronicles the efforts of evangelical progressives who expanded the concept of morality from the personal to the social and showed the way&#x2014;organizationally and through political activism&#x2014;to what would become the much larger and more influential evangelical right. By the 1980s, although they had witnessed the election of Jimmy Carter, the nation's first born-again president, progressive evangelicals found themselves in the political wilderness, riven by identity politics and alienated by a skeptical Democratic Party and a hostile religious right.</p><p>In the twenty-first century, evangelicals of nearly all political and denominational persuasions view social engagement as a fundamental responsibility of the faithful. This most dramatic of transformations is an important legacy of the evangelical left.</p></p><p>David R. Swartz teaches history at Asbury University.<p>"David Swartz has written a book of colorfully portrayed characters and credible storyline that strikes an elegant balance between politics, theology, social history and biographical narratives."&#x2014;<i>American Society of Church History</i></p><br><br><p>"<i>Moral Minority</i> is a vivid topography of a little-understood corner of evangelical thought."&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i></p><br><br><p>"In this superbly written study, David Swartz offers an excitingly fresh and compelling look at evangelical activists who forged a different ideological path in the age of Nixon and Reagan, one that veered left, away from the rightward trends of their day. Blending big-picture perspective with the colorful insight of biography, Swartz vividly describes his subjects' gospel of social justice and their struggles to win their church over to this progressive faith. In doing so, he force�fully reminds us that modern evangelicalism is neither monolithic nor static in its political persuasions and quest for impact. As both good history and timely observation, this is an important book."&#x2014;Darren Dochuk, author of <i>From Bible Belt to Sunbelt: Plain-folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism</i></p><br><br><p>"In this remarkably rigorous, richly contextualized, and generally exhaustive exploration of the evangelical Left, David R. Swartz returns readers to a time when theologically conservative Protestantism was 'politically up for grabs.'"&#x2014;<i>Journal of American History</i></p><br><br><p>"Swartz restores the evangelical left to its important place in the annals of post-sixties American evangelicalism.

Resonating with emotional intensity and narrativeinnovation reminiscent of Ann Patchett&#x2019;s <em>Bel</em><em> Canto</em>, Barbara Kingsolver&#x2019;s <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em>, and Zora Neale Hurston&#x2019;s <em>TheirEyes Were Watching God</em>, Haigh&#x2019;s <em>Mrs. Kimble </em>is a timeless story ofgrief, passion, heartache, deception, and the complex riddle of love.</p><p>Sometimes a book can be utterly full of holes and you still can't put it down. In <i>Mrs. Kimble</i>, first-time novelist Jennifer Haigh follows the marital career of Ken Kimble, opportunist, serial husband, and all around schmuck. The first section, set in Virginia in the 1960s, revolves around alcoholic first wife Birdie. As we enter the story, Kimble has already left her alone with two small children she is ill equipped to raise on her own. Kimble's absence in this section sets the tone for the book, which is not so much about Kimble himself as it is about the women he dupes over the years. Next up is Joan, a <i>Newsweek</i> reporter recovering from a mastectomy at her late father's home in Florida. A wealthy, confident woman left unsteady by breast cancer, she falls for Kimble, who now turns up in a hippie-ish incarnation. In the final section, Kimble weds Dinah, who had been his children's babysitter back in Virginia. Their marriage unravels as, at the end of the book, Kimble's secrets are revealed one by one. Unfortunately, the central secret of the book is never laid bare: how did the man get to be such a jerk? Other problems are never dealt with, either: we never believe a whip-smart woman like Joan could be so transparently snow-jobbed. We never understand why Dinah stays with an aging crook. Nevertheless, <i>Mrs. Kimble</i> is still engrossing. Haigh is so gifted at creating vivid scenes and strong characters, we find ourselves surrendering our disbelief despite our better judgment. This isn't the terrific book it might have been, but it's still a superior read. <i>--Claire Dederer</i><p>In her masterful first novel <em>Mrs. Kimble,</em> Jennifer Haigh delivers the compelling story of three women who marry the same man -- an enigmatic opportunist named Ken Kimble.</p><p></p><em>Birdie. </em>1961.<p></p><p>He was the choir director at a Southern Bible college. At practice she followed his hands with her eyes. Watching him, she thought of the Piet�: Mary weeping over her son's crucified body, his naked arms smooth as milk, his chest delicately ribbed like the underside of a flower. She imagined his shoulders bare beneath his shirt, his body long and white. One evening he approached her after practice.</p><p></p><em>Joan.</em> 1969.<p></p><p>She met him at a pool party in Florida. His lank dark hair hung to his shoulders; he wore faded jeans and a colorful cotton blouse. His eyes were a startling blue. No man had touched her in a year. He was engaged to someone else.</p><p></p><em>Dinah.</em> 1979<p></p><p>They met by accident in Washington, D.C. Their paths had intersected once before, when she was a teenager. "You're a beautiful girl," he'd told her, oblivious to the hideous scar on her face. He was old enough to be her father.</p><p>Kimble is revealed through the eyes of the women he seduces: his first wife, Birdie Bell, who struggles to hold herself together in the months following his desertion; his second wife, Joan Cohen, a lonely heiress shaken by personal tragedy, who sees in Kimble her last chance at happiness; and finally Dinah Whitacre, a beautiful but damaged woman half his age. Woven throughout is the story of Kimble's son, Charlie, whose life is forever affected by a father he barely remembers. Ken Kimble is a chameleon, a man able to become, at least for a while, all things to all women. To each of the three Mrs. Kimbles, he appears as a hero to whom powerful needs and nameless longings may be attached. Only later do they glimpse the truth about this elusive, unknowable man.</p><p>A captivating exploration of human love, marriage, and the illusions upon which it is founded, <em>Mrs. Kimble</em> presents a fascinating psychological portrait of a mesmerizing opportunist and the women who believe in him. Beautifully wrought, stunningly original, Jennifer Haigh's sparkling debut marks the arrival of a remarkable new talent.</p></p><h2>Studies in Alchemy: The Science of Self-Transformation (Way of Life Books)</h2><p>Voltaire, in a letter to Frederick II, referred to him as &#34;a man who never dies, and who knows everything.&#34; Saint Germain is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating personalities of recorded history. The activities of this illustrious master have been documented for more than a century (1710 - 1822) throughout the courts of Europe. To the peoples of many lands Saint Germain was considered a citizen, for he spoke twelve languages with the fluency of a native. Composing and improvising on the piano without music and playing the violin &#34;like an orchestra&#34; or but a few of the achievements that demonstrate the stunning genius of the &#34;Wonderman of Europe.&#34; To remove the false from precious gems was a simple task for the master alchemist. Neither was beyond his ability to transmute base metals into gold. According to the confidence in the court of Louis XV, Madame Pompadour, he possessed a miraculous elixir that could prolong life. Aside from the prodigious, Saint Germain&#39;s strongest attribute is his devotion to the freedom and enlightenment of all mankind. His never-ending service to life will stand as a tribute to this distinguished master for generations to come. In Studies in Alchemy, Saint Germain conveys the knowledge of the sacred science that no man or woman should be without.

He had a 4.0 GPA, friends he could trust, and a girl he loved. Now he spends his days smoked out, not so much living as simply existing. <br> <br> But his herbal endeavors -- and personal demons -- have lead to a severe lack of motivation. Steve's flunking out, but if he writes a one-hundred-page paper, he can graduate. <br> <br> Steve realizes he must write what he knows. And through telling the story of how he got to where he is, he discovers exactly where he wants to be....</p><p>In order to pass English class and graduate, 18-year-old Steve York has to write a 100- page essay about his life. What sounds like a run-of-the-mill writing assignment, however, becomes an excuse for Steve to reflect on the last four years (from Texas freshman to California senior), and figure out where it all went wrong. Maybe it was when he discovered that he really couldn't relate to his father, the Famous Astronaut. Or it could be because his "heart had been run through frapp�, puree, and liquefy on a love blender" by his ex-girlfriend, Wanda "Dub" Varner. No matter where the finger of blame ends up pointing, it's a wild ride of self-enlightenment as Steve discovers that not all relationships are permanent, and that some--like the one with his dad--can be mended with a little work. With Steve, author Rob Thomas has taken a teenage outsider and given him a funny, intelligent voice: "There are those males who merely fill ear holes with tiny studs hardly big enough to offend a Marine. Not me. Most days I wear big hoops. When I combine the look with a doo rag, I'm a regular pirate." As with his other novels--<i>Doing Time</i> and <i>Slave Day</i>--Thomas proves his thorough grasp of young adult issues and emotions. Teens will appreciate the author's empathy and humor, and teachers and parents will examine his work for clues to the mystery of adolescence.

Girzone's Joshua novels and the fables of Og Mandino, Brady (Band-Aides, Bullets &amp; Booze) offers a whimsical tale of a journey toward spiritual fulfillment. Trauma nurse Christine Moore hates men, work and life. At 30, she had run as far and as fast as she could from boring New Valley Community Hospital and her lover, a doctor who refused to marry her. Seven years later, she is back where she started, only now the doctor is married to her worst enemy. Depressed, Christine hits the local bar, where she meets the very last person she expects: God Himself (aka Joe), and on a Harley, no less. God gives her six individualized commandments. Change comes hard for Christine, but change she does-new image, new apartment, new hours, new attitude-as she grows and opens her eyes and heart to life and new opportunities. The Lord's new commandments are so sweeping ("Drop the ego. Be real. And watch what happens"; "All things are possible all of the time") as to be practically useless to anyone looking for serious guidance, and Christine's transformation based on them is about as believable as her running into God in the first place. Moses, Brady isn't-but despite its simplemindedness, her tale is funny and enjoyable in a fairy-tale kind of way. Major ad/promo; simultaneous Simon &amp; Schuster audio; rights: Stinson Literary Agency. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Disgruntled nurse Christine Moore, still single at 37, stumbles while leaving a bar. She is helped to her feet by a handsome hunk of a Harley rider who says his name is Joe but who is, well, God. He knows all about her, answers her questions before she speaks them, and criticizes and counsels her in a totally disarming way. Moreover, when Christine follows his advice--his "customized set of commandments" --her life improves. She starts dressing more comfortably and cuts down on cosmetics, moves near the beach and reduces her consumption, drops to half-time and discovers she loves her work, relaxes and becomes optimistic about life's possibilities. Finally, she finds a real man. Brady's theologized self-improvement fable is heretical in the good old American way: individualism and progress ("We're all always evolving, getting better. . . . Even me," Joe-God says) are the foremost articles of faith it inculcates. That will upset more conventionally religious readers but, Pocket Books hopes, appeal mightily to the Christian New Agers who've made <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i> a megaseller.

This abridged version of the classic is presented in a slick format that intersperses factual information, full-color pictures, and labeled diagrams throughout the story. Although the artwork is excellent, it contributes more gloss than substance and may even distract from the importance of Sewell's theme of the often inhumane treatment of horses. The images of their suffering rarely convey how painful their lives could be. Even at the worst moments of his life, Black Beauty never appears ribby or sweated up and his coat never loses its sheen. Only Ginger takes on all of the traits that an abused horse might exhibit, and this occurs in only one illustration. One sketch also shows a neglected horse. The information about horses often consists of broad statements that are sometimes incomplete. For example, after heavy exercise, a horse should be cooled out and not just blanketed and left standing. Horses' hooves don't usually break, they break up (chip, get cracks). The historical information about the different types of carriages and vignettes of life in the 19th century may be more useful and accurate. This classic deserves to be read in its entirety so that its message about the need to treat animals humanely is not diluted. Many young readers will be dazzled by the illustrations but the story is really shortchanged by them.?Carol Schene, Taunton Public Schools, MA<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>You Wouldn&#39;t Want To Be In Alexander The Great&#39;s Army!: Miles You&#39;d Rather Not March</h2><p>In another addition to a darkly humorous series, the reader joins King Philip&#39;s army to take down mighty Greece, but when Philip is killed, his son Alexander takes over and leads you into a terrible new battle filled with ferocious fights, endless marches, and desert sandstorms.

She is also the author of <i>Misoso: Once Upon a Time Tales from Africa</i> and <i>Travelling to Tondo,</i> both chosen as Notable Books by the American Library Association, as well as <i>Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears,</i> which won the 1976 Caldecott medal. Mrs. Aardema lives in Fort Meyers, Florida.An irrepressible youth turns a missed opportunity into good fortune in this frenetic retelling of an African folktale from Aardema (This for That, 1997, etc.). When his father, the chief of his people, dies, Koi is out hunting and so misses the division of property among his brothers (including the distribution of ivory tusks), leaving him with a lone kola tree as his inheritance. Undeterred, Koi sees this as a chance to explore the world. On his journey, he encounters several creatures who are in need of assistance: a snake with a sick mother, a frantic army of ants fleeing the Forest Devil, and a penitent crocodile facing the wrath of the Rainmaker, whose dog he ate. Koi's kola nuts are always the answer to the desperate animals' prayers. When he comes upon the realm of Chief Fulikolli, a ragged Koi accepts the challenge of winning the hand of the chief's daughter and one half of his chiefdom. With the aid of the grateful creatures, Koi performs three seemingly impossible tasks. Laced with the liberal humor that is Aardema's hallmark, Koi's story and his sturdy spirit will draw readers in, as will the many uses of the kola nut and the lesson of doing good for others. In Cepeda's vibrant illustrations, the Liberian landscape glistens and its people dance across the page, while the last sceneof Koi as a chiefis a portrait of ebullience rewarded.

Today&#39;s instantaneous access to an online array of information and resources from brochures to portals to Web 2.0 social media - means buyers can quietly self-educate and autonomously direct the pace, direction, and timing of the purchase (not sales) cycle. For companies accustomed to relying on trained sales professionals to act as trusted advisors and guide buyers through a defined, structured process from the very inception of the sales opportunity - these changes are potentially disruptive on a massive scale. In this virtual marketing environment, a savvy sales rep can no longer read the room. Today, B2B marketers must decode a buyer s digital body language to understand the roles, information needs, timing, and buying intentions of its largely faceless and elusive target market. In this thoughtful and groundbreaking book, Steven Woods helps B2B marketing professionals understand the new dynamics of marketing complex products and services. He walks through the new tools available to buyers, how to read digital body language, and how to respond most effectively to maximize the volume and quality of leads. Woods shows that, by embracing the concept of digital body language, marketers can re-engage with sales colleagues on a more strategic level and increase their value to the enterprise.</p><p>Steven Woods has been a leader in the current transformation of marketing since 1999 when he co-founded Eloqua. Through his work with hundreds of today&#39;s most innovative marketers, he has guided, been involved with, and written about many aspects of the changes currently under way in business to business and considered purchase marketing. Through both his writing and his leadership in creating the technology platform that today&#39;s best marketers require, Steven has been recognized as one of the top influencers in the CRM field. In this book, Steven distills his insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by today&#39;s marketers into a framework for thinking about their audience, and their role, in a new way. Steven holds a degree in Engineering Physics from Queen&#39;s University.</p><h2>Aramaic Light on the Acts of the Apostles</h2><p>Aramaic Light on the Acts of the Apostles, New Testament Series Volume 4, is a unique commentary based on Aramaic, the language of Jesus, and on ancient Near/Middle Eastern customs and manners. This volume presents new insights into and understanding of the words and idioms as they were used by Jesus, his apostles and contemporaries. <p>The method and style of writing is simple, informative, and scholarly, without using specialized theological terminology. Dr. Errico and Dr. Lamsa acts as guides, revealing to the Western mind a more intimate picture of the socio-religious and psychological environment of the times. The book of Acts comes alive under their skillful and cultural approach. They bring clarification to many misunderstood verses of scripture and episodic experiences of the apostles and growth of Jesus&#x2019; spiritual movement under apostolic guidance. Topics include: The Ascension of Jesus, Pentecost and the Descent of the Holy Spirit, Paul&#x2019;s Conversion, Healing Methods, and more. </p><p>This volume is not just a revision of Dr. Lamsa&#x2019;s commentaries, New Testament Commentary, 1945, and More Light on the Gospel, 1968. Dr. Errico has edited, expanded and annotated these previous works in the new format that Dr Lamsa desired. In addition, this book contains unpublished material that the two of them outlined prior to Dr Lamsa&#x2019;s death in 1975. Dr Errico completed these comments and has added information derived from his continual research in Near Eastern Semitic studies.</p></p><p>DR. ROCCO A. ERRICO, Ph.D., D.D., is an ordained minister, author and lecturer and one of the nations&#x2019;s leading biblical scholars working from the original Aramaic texts. Dr. Errico is the recipient of numerous awards and academic degrees, including a doctorate in Letters from the College of Seminarians, The Apostolic Succession of Antioch and the Church of the East&#x2014;American See, a doctorate in Divinity from St. Ephrem&#x2019;s Institute in Sweden, and a doctorate in Philosophy from the School of Christianity in Los Angeles. For ten years he studied intensively with Dr. George M. Lamsa, world-renowned native Assyrian scholar of the Scriptures. In 1970 Dr. Errico established the Noohra Foundation, which is dedicated to helping people of all faiths to understand the Near Eastern background and Aramaic interpretation of the Bible. <p>GEORGE M. LAMSA, Th.D. (1892-1975) was born in a civilization with customs, manners and language almost identical to those in the time of Jesus. His native tongue was full of similar idioms and parables, untouched by the outside world in 1900 years. Dr. Lamsa&#x2019;s formal education began under the priests and deacons of the ancient Church of the East and he later graduated with the highest honors ever bestowed from the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x2019;s Colleges in Iran and Turkey. After arriving in the United States, he devoted his life to translating the Holy Bible from the Ancient Eastern Text and also authored numerous biblical commentaries.</p></p><h2>Everything&#39;s Coming Up Josey (Josey, Book 1)</h2><p>"I need you," the tall, good-looking missionary had said...but he'd been speaking to Josey's entire church at the time. Had she taken it too literally? Because she was no longer in Gull Lake, Minnesota. She was a missionary. In Russia. For a year.<br>True, Josey had wanted to skip town when her sister married her ex, and her secret crush/best friend got engaged. But Russia? Yet after a few weeks the idea grew on her. She could speak enough words to buy fruit at the Moscow market, and the missionary role was feeling...right (although her bagel-thieving roommate tested her daily). Even the frosty Russian weather was no big deal for this Minnesota girl&nbsp;&#x2014; it was getting her love life to thaw that was the real challenge!</p><p>Christy Award finalist Susan May Warren lives in Minnesota with her husband and our children. She and her husband previously served as missionaries with SEND International in Khabarovsk, Far East Russia.<p>It's important to acknowledge that Chase was right and if it weren't for him I might have never found my answers. He likes being right. And, for the most part, he's consistent in his predictions&nbsp;&#x2014; has been for all of the twenty-four years I've known him. Like the time we raced down Bloomquist mountain on our Radio Flyers. He sat in his wagon, hands white from gripping the handle, and grinned against the sun, a dark shadow of superiority and wisdom. "I'm going to win, and you're gonna get hurt," he said.</p> <p>At seven, and full of tomboyish bravado, I tucked my feet into my red wagon, grabbed the handle and pushed off. The world whooshed by my ears as we careened down dirt and gravel. My next clear memory is staring into the glaring sunshine from a sprawled position in the ditch. The wagon lay on its side, wheels still spinning. And pain. I remember pain. Blinding, screaming, burning down one side of my leg where I'd left way too much skin on the road.</p> <p>And then Chase.He stood broad and tall,blocking the sun, blue eyes full of concern. What came next ignited my love/hate feelings for him for the next decade or two. He picked me up, one hand around my waist and said, "Josey, you just don't know when to quit."</p> <p>I took it as a compliment.</p> <p>I should have paid attention to the gleam in his eyes&nbsp;&#x2014; the one that said,"Told you so!" It was the first sign that he would break my heart, and a smart girl would have gathered up her battered wagon and headed for cookies and milk. But what does a seven-year-old know of the shades of love? All I knew is that he ran faster and could eat more than me, and his Tarzan whoop, with that little inflection in his voice,sounded right out of the jungle and left me with tingles.</p> <p>Most of all, he had the best backyard sandbox on the street. That fact alone made him downright irresistible.</p> <p>Fast-forward seventeen years.Chase sits down at the linen-clothed table, a scant breeze pushing around that burnished blond hair, that same knowing gleam in his eyes and he says, "You didn't want him anyway."</p> <p>Unfortunately he's referring to the groom, who is presently dancing with his new bride center stage behind me&nbsp;&#x2014; a man who has soft gray eyes and a smile that can turn the right girl to oatmeal.My ex-boyfriend,Milton Snodbrecher.</p> <p>And oh, the bride&nbsp;&#x2014; wearing lily-of-the-valley in her blond hair, and a Vera Wang dress off a rack in Minneapolis&nbsp;&#x2014; is my sister, Jasmine. My younger sister.</p> <p>Isn't it written somewhere,"Nay shall thine youngest sibling marrieth before thine oldest?" Perhaps, the <i>Bible? </i>I'm suddenly feeling a kinship with Leah the morning after, when Jacob realized he'd been hoodwinked.</p> <p>How could I have believed that Milton might work seven years, let alone seven months, for my love?</p> <p>Who knew that getting my college boyfriend/jerk a job at our restaurant/lodge in central Minnesota doing the books would slaughter my matrimonial prospects? I thought it sounded like a pretty good idea. Especially since I was just down the road dotting<i> i</i>"s and crossing<i> t</i>"s at the<i> Gull Lake Gazette.</i></p> <p>I do get my own attic office facing the lake with the ohso-picturesque view of the seagulls squatting on the roof and ogling the goodies piled near the back entry to Lou's smoked fish shack. It's breathtaking, to say the least.</p> <p>It boils down to this&nbsp;&#x2014; while I was rewriting news blurbs from the AP wire and trying to make sense of eighty-three-year-old Tipsy McKeever's scrawled recipes, Milton was getting familiar with more than the books at the old Berglund resort."Bring Milton home and we'll give him a job at the family business," (five acres of shore front, general store and five small cabins) said Dad. My summer-after-graduation, wedding-saturated brain thought,<i> Yes.</i> Embraced by the pine and birch, swept fresh by the breeze of Gull Lake, Milton would finally drop to his then-bony knees and declare his love. And we'd all live happily ever after.</p> <p>Naive me.</p> <p>I should interject here that I wasn't even supposed to be in Gull Lake. My grand life plan included a stint at a New York newspaper, maybe even a tour as an overseas journalist for the Associated Press. Inside this five-foot-four-inch, slightly over-endowed (I did <i>not </i>say fat) body lives a hard-muscled, brave and adventurous, tomb-raiding Lara Croft/Mother Teresa blend, itching to toss the seeds of faith as she cracks open diabolical plots to enslave humanity.</p> <p>In short, I had hoped to make an etching on the spiritual landscape of the world. To follow the Matthew 28 Great Commission (and look good doing it).</p> <p>Sadly, there isn't a plethora of enslaving despots in Gull Lake,MN.Except,perhaps,my mother,who somehow talked me into working as head of housekeeping (read: the only maid on staff) on Saturdays. Note to self: don't believe it when your mother suggests you come home for a little while until you get your bills paid off and figure out where you want to go next. It's a ploy. Before you know it you'll have an account at the local Java Cup, a library card and a standing order for Jerry's Friday night pizza special, while every available bachelor slinks out of town for greener pastures.</p> <p>Not that there were many eligibles to begin with. Chase, perhaps, only he doesn't count.</p> <p>But I digress. Milton and Jasmine&nbsp;&#x2014; how did it happen? While I was bent over the hieroglyphics of the local Dear Ruth column, Jasmine used her formerly unbeknownst charms to wheedle down the road to my man's heart. No, not that road.His stomach.Out of all the pastries in the Norwegian's arsenal&nbsp;&#x2014; <i>lefse, krumkaga, roll kuchen&nbsp;&#x2014; </i>I especially blame the <i>kringle,</i> that flaky, almond-frosted pastry that calls to a good Norseman's (or woman's) heart early Saturday mornings. Good old Jasmine, our junior baker, had the boy eating out of her hands.Literally.I should have seen the writing on the wall&nbsp;&#x2014; or on his face, rather&nbsp;&#x2014; when I found him, face flaky and dripping sugar within two days of his arrival.</p> <p>In Jasmine's defense, she can't help it if she can bake like heaven, or that Milton is a true Scandinavian.</p> <p>He gained thirty pounds in seven months. One hundred and thirty the next year by adding my sister to his list of assets. Remember, he's a bookkeeper. I guess he thought the skinny one with the eager smile and associate degree in Home Economic Arts was the Berglund who offered the greatest long-term benefits.</p> <p>The sad thing is that I thought Milton and I made a good couple. We loved reading, and...well, reading. He played a cutthroat game of Boggle, and could occasionally smoke me in Scrabble. Mostly, we studied together at college, which I suppose doesn't produce the elements of a good spouse, but rather an excellent quizzer&nbsp;&#x2014;"How many lines are in a sonnet?"</p> <p>On a saner day I might recognize the peril of bringing such a trait into a marriage."Name for me the leading ways to unclog a drain. Give me the three causes of apathy in a relationship."</p> <p>And he had the uncanny ability to spoil every romantic climax in a chick flick,e.g.,knuckle-cracking during the toll-booth proposal in <i>While You Were Sleeping.</i> I had to fight the gut urge to rip out his eyebrows one hair at a time&nbsp;&#x2014; a response that surprised me and should have forewarned of darkness yet to come. And what was with his need to circle the parking lot eighteen times before finding the perfect place? I called it Vulture Parking.</p> <p>He called me uptight.</p> <p>The breakup wasn't pretty. And made even uglier by his nearly immediate pursuit of Jasmine. Can anyone say Vulture Parking?</p> <p>Which brings me to the present, when I'm banging my head on the linen-covered tables,arranged expertly by Susie's Catering on the front yard of the Berglund Acres, thinking, "This is a joke,<i> right?</i>" A cool, end-of-May twilight breeze rustles the linen tablecloths and the lily-and-lilac centerpieces. I'm purposely not watching the happy couple circle the dance floor, and wishing that I weren't wearing a dress that makes me look like a poppy.</p> <p>Oh,yes,marshmallow-me agreed to be the maid of honor. Like my mother said,"Wouldn't the wedding pictures look nice with our whole family in them?" Hello, did anyone else&nbsp;&#x2014; Grandma Netta, my brother Buddy, Jasmine the groom-stealer or either of my beaming parents&nbsp;&#x2014; notice that the groom used to belong to me? That this moment in my life might be slightly painful?</p> <p><i>Not.</i> I've never been able to outflank my mother. She could teach an online course in practicality. So here I sit, my cleavage pushing out of the princess top (hey, I like <i>kringle, </i>too!), wanting to melt into a poppy puddle, or maybe just make a run for the border, when over to my side of misery slides Chase. I didn't exactly expect him to show up at the wedding,but when I spied him an hour ago weaving his way through the receiving line, I suddenly felt as if God might care, just a little. Despite the poppy dress. And, although I've spent most of the last hour hiding in the kitchen, I'm not sad Chase has found me.</p> <p>That's his specialty, actually. Chase-Me, I called him (not to his face...<i>please!</i>) in high school.Most of the time I meant it in a good way.</p> <p>"What?" I say in greeting, not able to look at Chase full in the face.</p> <p>"I saw Jerry."</p> <p><i>Oh, thanks, Chase.</i> Could you please bring up every small-town mistake I've ever made? I shrug, as if this is news but I don't care, although, yes, I know my senior prom date/successful lawyer is back in town. I still track his movements like a panther, lifting my ears with every mention of his name, my nose to the wind, hoping to catch his scent. He's arrived for the wedding, good friend of the family that he is. Good thing I don't have another sister.</p> <p>Suddenly I feel a little sick. "You're looking...what color is that exactly?" I hear him chuckle.</p> <p>"Get away from me." I lower my head onto my arm. It's a beautiful day out, waves from the lake lapping the shore, the smell of summer in the breeze. The sun, of course, is totally on Jasmine's side. Okay, I admit it! Evil me did walk in the smallest of circles this morning saying, under my breath of course,"Tut tut,it looks like rain."But Jasmine must be much holier than I, because God heard and answered her prayers.</p> <p>Okay, I'm not that mean to really want it to rain. But a little ripple of thunder might have been nice. Just to shake things up.</p> <p>"You look good," I say, to lessen my bark. I don't actually look at Chase, but he always looks good, so I'm being honest. Thankfully, Chase alone understands the knife-in-thegut affair this is. He, too, is a last fish in the sea. I figure that in our geriatric years, we'll be hobbling to the local library from North Shore Acres,still trying to race each other down the hill.</p> <p>I'm thankful for some consistencies in my life.He told me, sophomore year, as he hid out at Berglund Acres during one of his parents' many skirmishes, that he'd pull out his fingernails one by one before he even thought about trudging down the aisle.</p> <p>Yet, here he is, at the scene of the crime to help me through this moment of need. I find a smile.</p> <p>"It's not really all that bad, is it?" He puts his hand on my shoulder."I mean, c'mon, G.I., the guy has three chins."</p> <p>"He didn't when I was dating him."</p> <p>I'm moved by both Chase's touch,his warm,strong hands, and the use of his nickname for me.He couldn't bear to think of me as a girl when we were seven, so he called me G.I. Joe. Not that I minded, but I didn't so much love his later embellishments, Gastro-Intestinal, The Great I, and my least favorite, Gone Insane. But his tone is sweet, and the G.I. term makes me warm in a way that has nothing to do with the sunny May day.</p></p><h2>The Complete Serger Handbook</h2><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing better than an author who&#x2019;s made all the mistakes herself, has taught hundreds of others, and writes with humor. Chris James fills the bill. This beautiful book talks about knits, rolled hems, and flatlocking. At the end is a trouble-shooting guide....The close-up color photos make her text even more understandable....highly recommended.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Creative Machine</i>. &#x201c;The most comprehensive reference on serging to date.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Craft &amp; Needlework Age.</i><br></p><p>Writing this work has given James the opportunity to encapsulate the techniques she has developed during 15 years of teaching. The result is a concise guide to the serger and serger techniques. Major sections of the book include identifying the parts of a serger (with photos of each part), serger accessories, types of threads, threading and testing the threading, learning to regulate tension, and techniques. Throughout, James emphasizes using a knowledge of serger threading, needles, and tension to solve any problems relating to stitch formation.

In 1952 came <i>ONE</i>, the first widely distributed gay periodical (in which, by the way, the love-hate relationship between gay publishing and advertisers began), and in 1953, <i>The Ladder</i> (the first public forum for lesbians), the <i>Mattachine Review</i>, and an FBI investigation of gay-lesbian publishing. Since then, Americans have seen the gay-lesbian press attempt to define gay ideology, champion "appropriate" lesbian dress and appearance codes, promote the founding of a separate gay nation as part of the 1960s gay liberation movement, and, above all, grow. The <i>Advocate</i>, the nation's first gay newspaper, came to dominate the field; definitions of gay and lesbian culture and, with them, "herstory," continued to change; the gay press responded to AIDS; various sexual activities became politicized; and gay publishing endured "mainstreaming." With this introductory survey of an understudied category of journalism, Streitmatter provides the basis for further exploration. <i>Whitney Scott</i>Streitmatter (journalism, School of Communication, American University) has written an engaging history of one segment of the alternative press: general interest publications aimed at lesbians and/or gay men and created and owned by gay people. Of some 2600 titles published since the 1940s, a dozen or so?from Vice Versa (1947-48), America's first lesbian magazine, to Out (1992-present)?are examined at length, chronicling the evolution of the gay rights movement from peeks out of the closet to street protests. Tracing the progression of the gay media from anonymous, mimeographed radical manifestos to glossy lifestyle magazines driven by brand-name advertisers, Streitmatter observes a shift from an activist to a mainstream editorial slant, especially by publications with large circulations. Recommended for both large public libraries and academic libraries, especially those with programs in journalism and gay, gender, or minority studies.?Jo McClamroch, Xavier Univ.

His novel Tree of Smoke was the 2007 winner of the National Book Award.<b>Train Dreams</b>&nbsp;<b>1</b><b>I</b>n the summer of 1917 Robert Grainier took part in an attempt on the life of a Chinese laborer caught, or anyway accused of, stealing from the company stores of the Spokane International Railway in the Idaho Panhandle.Three of the railroad gang put the thief under restraint and dragged him up the long bank toward the bridge under construction fifty feet above the Moyea River. A rapid singsong streamed from the Chinaman voluminously. He shipped and twisted like a weasel in a sack, lashing backward with his one free fist at the man lugging him by the neck. As this group passed him, Grainier, seeing them in some distress, lent assistance and found himself holding one of the culprit's bare feet. The man facing him, Mr. Sears, of Spokane International's management, held the prisoner almost uselessly by the armpit and was the only one of them, besides the incomprehensible Chinaman, to talk during the hardest part of their labors: "Boys, I'm damned if we ever see the top of this heap!" Then we're hauling him all the way? was the question Grainier wished to ask, but he thought it better to save his breath for the struggle. Sears laughed once, his face pale with fatigue and horror. They all went down in the dust and got righted, went down again, the Chinaman speaking in tongues and terrifying the four of them to the point that whatever they may have had in mind at the outset, he was a deader now. Nothing would do but to toss him off the trestle.They came abreast of the others, a gang of a dozen men pausing in the sun to lean on their tools and wipe at sweat and watch this thing. Grainier held on convulsively to the Chinaman's horny foot, wondering at himself, and the man with the other foot let loose and sat down gasping in the dirt and got himself kicked in the eye before Grainier took charge of the free-flailing limb. "It was just for fun. For fun," the man sitting in the dirt said, and to his confederate there he said, "Come on, Jel Toomis, let's give it up." "I can't let loose," this Mr. Toomis said, "I'm the one's got him by the neck!" and laughed with a gust of confusion passing across his features. "Well, I've got him!" Grainier said, catching both the little demon's feet tighter in his embrace. "I've got the bastard, and I'm your man!"The party of executioners got to the midst of the last completed span, sixty feet above the rapids, and made every effort to toss the Chinaman over. But he bested them by clinging to their arms and legs, weeping his gibberish, until suddenly he let go and grabbed the beam beneath him with one hand. He kicked free of his captors easily, as they were trying to shed themselves of him anyway, and went over the side, dangling over the gorge and making hand-over-hand out over the river on the skeleton form of the next span. Mr. Toomis's companion rushed over now, balancing on a beam, kicking at the fellow's fingers. The Chinaman dropped from beam to beam like a circus artist downward along the crosshatch structure. A couple of the work gang cheered his escape, while others, though not quite certain why he was being chased, shouted that the villain ought to be stopped. Mr. Sears removed from the holster on his belt a large old four-shot black-powder revolver and took his four, to no effect. By then the Chinaman had vanished.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Hiking to his home after this incident, Grainier detoured two miles to the store at the railroad village of Meadow Creek to get a bottle of Hood's Sarsaparilla for his wife, Gladys, and their infant daughter, Kate. It was hot going up the hill through the woods toward the cabin, and before getting the last mile he stopped and bathed in the river, the Moyea, at a deep place upstream from the village.It was Saturday night, and in preparation for the evening a number of the railroad gang from Meadow Creek were gathered at the hole, bathing with their clothes on and sitting themselves out on the rocks to dry before the last of the daylight left the canyon. The men left their shoes and boots aside and waded in slowly up to their shoulders, whooping and splashing. Many of the men already sipped whiskey from flasks as they sat shivering after their ablutions. Here and there an arm and hand clutching a shabby hat jutted from the surface while somebody got his head wet. Grainier recognized nobody and stayed off by himself and kept a close eye on his boots and his bottle of sarsaparilla.Walking home in the falling dark, Grainier almost met the Chinaman everywhere. Chinaman in the road. Chinaman in the woods. Chinaman walking softly, dangling his hands on arms like ropes. Chinaman dancing up out of the creek like a spider.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;He gave the Hood's to Gladys. She sat up in bed by the stove, nursing the baby at her breast, down with a case of the salt rheum. She could easily have braved it and done her washing and cut up potatoes and trout for supper, but it was their custom to let her lie up with a bottle or two of the sweet-tasting Hood's tonic when her head ached and her nose stopped, and get a holiday from such chores. Grainier's baby daughter, too, looked rheumy. Her eyes were a bit crusted and the discharge bubbled pendulously at her nostrils while she suckled and snorted at her mother's breast. Kate was four months old, still entirely bald. She did not seem to recognize him. Her little illness wouldn't hurt her as long as she didn't develop a cough out of it.Now Grainier stood by the table in the single-room cabin and worried. The Chinaman, he was sure, had cursed them powerfully while they dragged him along, and any bad thing might come of it. Though astonished now at the frenzy of the afternoon, baffled by the violence, at how it had carried him away like a seed in a wind, young Grainier still wished they'd gone ahead and killed that Chinaman before he'd cursed them.He sat on the edge of the bed."Thank you, Bob," his wife said."Do you like your sarsaparilla?""I do. Yes, Bob.""Do you suppose little Kate can taste it out your teat?""Of course she can."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Many nights they heard the northbound Spokane International train as it passed through Meadow Creek, two miles down the valley. Tonight the distant whistle woke him, and he found himself alone in the straw bed.Gladys was up with Kate, sitting on the bench by the stove, scraping cold boiled oats off the sides of the pot and letting the baby suckle this porridge from the end of her finger."How much does she know, do you suppose, Gladys? As much as a dog-pup, do you suppose?""A dog-pup can live by its own after the bitch weans it away," Gladys said.He waited for her to explain what this meant. She often thought ahead of him."A man-child couldn't do that way," she said, "just go off and live after it was weaned. A dog knows more than a babe until the babe knows its words. But not just a few words. A dog raised around the house knows some words, too--as many as a baby.""How many words, Gladys?""You know," she said, "the words for its tricks and the things you tell it to do.""Just say some of the words, Glad." It was dark and he wanted to keep hearing her voice."Well, fetch, and come, and sit, and lay, and roll over. Whatever it knows to do, it knows the words."In the dark he felt his daughter's eyes turned on him like a cornered brute's. It was only his thoughts tricking him, but it poured something cold down his spine. He shuddered and pulled the quilt up to his neck.All of his life Robert Grainier was able to recall this very moment on this very night.Copyright � 2002 by Denis Johnson</p><h2>Samantha&#39;s Cooking Studio (American Girl Collection)</h2><p>You&#39;re the chef!

His series about the adventures of Lewis Barnavelt and his uncle Jonathan, which includes <i>The House with a Clock in Its Walls</i>, is a classic. He also wrote a series of novels featuring the character Johnny Dixon. Among the titles in that series are&nbsp;<i>The Curse of the Blue Figurine</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Mummy, the Will, and the Crypt</i>;&nbsp;and <i>The Spell of the Sorcerer&#x2019;s Skull</i>. His stand-alone novel&nbsp;<i>The Face in the Frost</i>&nbsp;is also regarded as a fantasy classic, and among his earlier works are&nbsp;<i>St. Fidgeta and Other Parodies</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Pedant and the Shuffly</i>.<br><br> Bellairs was a prolific writer, publishing more than a dozen novels before his untimely death in 1991.<br>&nbsp;Brad Strickland has written and cowritten forty-one novels, many of them for younger readers. He is the author of the fantasy trilogy&nbsp;<i>Moon Dreams</i>,<i>&nbsp;Nul&#x2019;s Quest</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Wizard&#x2019;s Mole</i>, and the creator of the popular horror novel&nbsp;<i>Shadowshow</i>. With his wife, Barbara, he has written for the Star Trek Young Adult book series, for Nickelodeon&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</i>&nbsp;book series, and for&nbsp;<i>Sabrina, the Teenage Witch</i>&nbsp;(Pocket Books). Both solo and with Thomas E. Fuller, he has written several books about Wishbone, public TV&#x2019;s literature-loving dog. When he's not writing, he&nbsp;teaches English at Gainesville College in Gainesville, Georgia. He and Barbara have two children, Amy and Jonathan, and a daughter-in-law, Rebecca. They live and work in Oakwood, Georgia.<br>Grade 5-8?Thirteen-year-old Johnny Dixon is back in this new adventure written by Strickland in the manner of John Bellairs. It's summer in the 1950s, and Johnny, as always, is living in Duston Heights, MA. He is able to get a job at the Gudge Museum with the help of his friend, Professor Childermass, and the professor's donation of a collection of bizarre artifacts made by the evil wizard Esdrias Blackleash during the time of the Salem witch trials. When Mattheus Mergal shows up from Boston looking to steal the collection's wooden hand, the story's pace speeds up, suspense escalates, and the supernatural fun begins. Complete with a haunted house, nightmares, wild storms, snakes, near-death by lightning, and even Johnny's imprisonment in a small, decorative snow globe, the story of Mergal's intent to raise his dead ancestor, the self-styled Emperor of the World, is stylistically a treat as well, full of foreshadowing and figurative language. Just as Duston Heights attracts eerie people like magnets, so will young pre-Stephen King fans be attracted to this spellbinding tale.?Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, ME<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Farber nudes</h2><p>Farber&#39;s sentual and often abstract photography celebrates the human form.

The song, "Which Side Are You On?," contrasts the lot of the working class and the bosses, and asks the listener to choose. This politically charged song was performed again during the Civil Rights Movement, with its lyrics appropriate to the 1960s. It was recorded more recently by Billy Bragg. Indeed, the story of this song might serve as a microcosm of the entire history of the folk music revival. Dick Weissman, former member of the Journeymen and a musician still releasing CDs of his original compositions, brings his personal and professional involvement to this definitive history. Which Side Are You On? includes chapters and sections on the Lomaxes, Harry Smith, the little known Lawrence Gellert, Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Leadbelly, Pete Seeger, groups such as the Weavers and the Kingston Trio, Dave Van Ronk, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Natalie Merchant, Ani Difranco, Bela Fleck, Nickel Creek, the Indigo Girls, and many others. Which Side Are You On? also explores the folk music business in depth: how it all works, where the power really lies, how the artists have been manipulated and often exploited, the dynamic between artist and audience. Though he writes as a historian, Weissman also has seen it all from the inside, and includes anecdotes that are both funny and poignant: My friend and guitarist-singer Artie Traum took care of one of two houses that Bob Dylan owned in Woodstock, some thirty five years ago. The house had thirty seven rooms! Artie was instructed not to give out Dylan's phone number to any caller. The first caller was Joan Baez, and Artie followed instructions, calling Dylan at the other house to relay the call. During Artie's house-sitting chores, I visited him. He took me on a brief tour of the house. In one room were sacks of mail. We randomly opened a half-dozen letters. The one that I remember was by a female fan in North Dakota. She had been to a Dylan concert and reminded him that they had met. There was something touching though pathetic about the letter.</p></p><p>Dick Weissman is a musician and writer. His book The Music Business: Career Opportunities and Self-Defense, now in its fifth edition, has sold 100,000 copies. The Folk Music Sourcebook, which Weissman co-authored, won the Deems Taylor ASCAP Music Critics Award. His most recent book is Which Side Are You On? An Inside History of the Folk Music Revival in America. Dick Weissman lives in Portland, OR.&#x201c;The inside scoop! Dick Weissman is a folk music insider with plenty to say about commercialization, self-serving scholars, and authentic musicians. His observations ring true and have the potential to shake things up. Weissman covers territory from Leadbelly to Dylan and beyond.

Dick doesn't start and end there, however; he providessome historical framework of early folklorists and song collectors and earlyfolk songs of protest and how they underlay and influenced the 60's folk musicrevival in the earliest chapters, and winds up with a brief look at folk musicand musicians from the post-'60s to the present day.

Weissman a player, composer, instructor, writer of books on the businessof music, and participator in folk organizations brings a unique perspective tothe lives, conflicts, barriers, community, and attitudes of musicians. This isfascinating reading and will give insight to the pitfalls of musicians fromnon-playing festivals to clubs musicians endure like a sleazy restaurant'smusician scam in Portland.

Instead, Katz focuses on the director's sexual liaisons and drug use to fashion a trashy biography that reads like a tabloid without being as interesting or as entertaining.

Moving from the drawing rooms of pre-war Paris to the lives of men and women in wartime France, here we find the beautiful work of a writer at the height of her tragically short career.</p><p><b>Ir�ne N�mirovsky</b> was born in Kiev in 1903 into a wealthy banking family and emigrated to France during the Russian Revolution. After attending the Sorbonne in Paris she began to write and swiftly achieved success with <b>David Golder</b>, which was followed by more than a dozen other books. Throughout her lifetime she published widely in French newspapers and literary journals. She died in Auschwitz in 1942. More than sixty years later, <b>Suite Fran�aise</b>, was published posthumously, for the first time, in 2006.Dimanche <br>[ Sunday ]<br><br>In rue las cases it was as quiet as during the height of summer, and every open window was screened by a yellow blind. The fine weather had returned: it was the first Sunday of spring, a warm and restless day that took people out of their houses and out of the city. The sky glowed with a gentle radiance. The birds in Place Sainte-Clotilde chirped lazily, while the raucous screeching of cars leaving for the country echoed in the peaceful streets. The only cloud in the sky was a delicately curled white shell that floated upward for a moment, then melted into the ether. People raised their heads with surprise and anticipation; they sniffed the air and smiled.<br><br>Agnes half-closed the shutters: the sun was hot and the roses would open too quickly and die. Nanette ran in and stood hopping from one foot to the other.<br><br>&#x201c;May I go out, Mama? It&#x2019;s such nice weather.&#x201d;<br><br>Mass was almost over. The children were already coming down the street in their bright sleeveless dresses, holding their prayer books in their white-gloved hands and clustering around a little girl who had just taken her first communion. Her round cheeks were pink and shining under her veil. A procession of bare legs, all pink and gold, as downy as the skin of a peach, sparkled in the sunshine. The bells were still ringing, slowly and sadly as if to say, &#x201c;Off you go, good people, we are sorry not to be able to keep you any longer. We have sheltered you for as long as we could, but now we have to give you back to the world and to your everyday lives. Time to go. Mass is over.&#x201d;<br><br>The bells fell silent. The smell of hot bread filled the street, wafting up from the open bakery; you could see the freshly washed floor gleaming and the narrow mirrors on the walls glinting faintly in the shadows. Then everyone had gone home.<br><br>Agnes said, &#x201c;Nanette, go and see if Papa is ready, and tell Nadine that lunch is on the table.&#x201d;<br><br>Guillaume came in, radiating the scent of lavender water and good cigars, which always made Agnes feel slightly nauseated. He seemed even more high-spirited, healthy, and plump than usual.<br><br>As soon as they had sat down, he announced, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be going out after lunch. When you&#x2019;ve been suffocating in Paris all week, it&#x2019;s the least . . . Are you really not tempted?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to leave the little one.&#x201d;<br><br>Nanette was sitting opposite him, and Guillaume smiled at her and tweaked her hair. The previous night she had had a temperature, but it had been so slight that her fresh complexion showed no sign of pallor.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not really ill. She has a good appetite.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m not worried, thank God,&#x201d; said Agnes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let her go out until four o&#x2019;clock. Where are you going?&#x201d;<br><br>Guillaume&#x2019;s face visibly clouded over. &#x201c;I . . . oh, I don&#x2019;t know yet . . . You always want to organize things in advance . . . Somewhere around Fontainebleau or Chartres, I&#x2019;ll see, wherever I end up. So? Will you come with me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to see the look on his face if I agreed,&#x201d; thought Agnes. The set smile on her lips annoyed her husband. But she answered, as she always did, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got things to do at home.&#x201d;<br><br>She thought, &#x201c;Who is it this time?&#x201d;<br><br>Guillaume&#x2019;s mistresses: her jealousy, her anxiety, the sleepless nights, were now in the long-distant past. He was tall and overweight, going bald, his whole body solidly balanced, his head firmly planted on a thick, strong neck. He was forty-five, the age at which men are at their most powerful, dominant, and self-confident, the blood coursing thickly through their veins. When he laughed he thrust his jaw forward to reveal a row of nearly perfect white teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;Which one of them told him, &#x2018;You look like a wolf or a wild animal when you smile&#x2019;?&#x201d; wondered Agnes. &#x201c;He must have been incredibly flattered. He never used to laugh like that.&#x201d;<br><br>She remembered how he used to weep in her arms every time a love affair ended, gulping as if he were trying to inhale his tears. Poor Guillaume . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I . . .&#x201d; said Nadine.<br><br>She started each sentence like that. It was impossible to detect a single word or a single idea in anything she thought or said that did not relate to herself, her clothes, her friends, the ladders in her stockings, her pocket money, her own pleasure. She was . . . triumphant. Her skin had the pale, velvety brightness of jasmine and of camellias, and you could see the blood beating just beneath the surface: it rose girlishly in her cheeks, swelling her lips so that it looked as though a pink, heady wine was about to gush from them. Her green eyes sparkled.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s twenty,&#x201d; thought Agnes, trying, as so often, to keep her eyes closed and not to be wounded by her daughter&#x2019;s almost overwhelming beauty, the peals of laughter, the egoism, the fervor, the diamondlike hardness. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s twenty years old; it&#x2019;s not her fault . . . Life will tame her, soften her, make her grow up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mama, can I take your red scarf? I won&#x2019;t lose it. And, Mama, may I come back late?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And where are you going?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mama, you know perfectly well! To Chantal Aumont&#x2019;s house in Saint-Cloud. Arlette is coming to fetch me. Can I come home late? After eight o&#x2019;clock, anyway? You won&#x2019;t be angry? Then I won&#x2019;t have to go through Saint-Cloud at seven o&#x2019;clock on a Sunday evening.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s quite right,&#x201d; said Guillaume.<br><br>Lunch was nearly over. Mariette was serving the meal quickly. Sunday . . . As soon as the washing-up was done, she, too, would be going out.<br><br>They ate orange-flavored cr�pes; Agnes had helped Mariette make the batter.<br><br>&#x201c;Delicious,&#x201d; said Guillaume appreciatively.<br><br>The clattering of dishes could be heard through the open windows: it was only a faint sound from the dark ground-floor flat where two spinsters lived in the gloom, but it was louder and livelier in the house across the way, where there was a table laid for twelve with the place settings gleaming on the neat folds of the damask tablecloth and a basket of white roses for a first communion decorating the center.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get ready, Mama. I don&#x2019;t want any coffee.&#x201d;<br><br>Guillaume swallowed his quickly and silently. Mariette began to clear the table.<br><br>&#x201c;What a hurry they&#x2019;re in,&#x201d; thought Agnes, as her thin, skillful hands deftly folded Nanette&#x2019;s napkin. &#x201c;Only I . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She was the only one for whom this wonderful Sunday held no attraction.<br><br>&#x201c;I never imagined she&#x2019;d become so stay-at-home and dull,&#x201d; thought Guillaume as he looked at her. He took a deep inward breath and, proudly conscious of the sense of vigor that surged through his body, felt his chest expand with the fine weather. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in rather good shape, holding up surprisingly well,&#x201d; he thought, as his mind turned to all the reasons (the political crisis, money worries, the taxes he owed, Germaine&#x2014;who cramped his style, devil take her) why he could justifiably feel as miserable and depressed as anyone else. But on the contrary! &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always been the same. A ray of sunshine, the prospect of a Sunday away from Paris, a nice bottle of wine, freedom, a pretty woman at my side&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m twenty again! I&#x2019;m alive,&#x201d; he congratulated himself, looking at his wife with veiled hostility; her cold beauty and the tense, mocking line of her lips irritated him. He said aloud, &#x201c;Of course, I&#x2019;ll telephone you if I spend the night in Chartres. In any case, I&#x2019;ll be back tomorrow morning, and I&#x2019;ll drop in at home before I go to the office.&#x201d;<br><br>Agnes thought, with a strange, weary detachment, &#x201c;One day, after a lavish lunch, just as he&#x2019;s kissing the woman he&#x2019;s with, the car he&#x2019;s driving will crash into a tree. I&#x2019;ll get a phone call from Senlis or Auxerre. Will you suffer?&#x201d; she demanded curiously of the mute, invisible image of herself waiting in the shadows. But the image, silent and indifferent, did not reply, and the powerful silhouette of Guillaume came between it and her.</p><h2>The Storyteller&#39;s Candle/La velita de los cuentos</h2><p>It is the winter of 1929, and cousins Hildamar and Santiago have just moved to enormous, chilly New York from their native Puerto Rico.

He illuminates the groundbreaking music of Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt, Schumann, and Debussy. He analyzes the breathtaking techniques of Glenn Gould, Oscar Peterson, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Arthur Rubinstein, and Van Cliburn, and he gives musicians including Alfred Brendel, Murray Perahia, Menahem Pressler, and Vladimir Horowitz the opportunity to discuss their approaches. Isacoff delineates how classical music and jazz influenced each other as the uniquely American art form progressed from ragtime, novelty, stride, boogie, bebop, and beyond, through Scott Joplin, Fats Waller, Duke Ellington, Bill Evans, Thelonious Monk, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Cecil Taylor, and Bill Charlap.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>A Natural History of the Piano</i> distills a lifetime of research and passion into one brilliant narrative. We witness Mozart unveiling his monumental concertos in Vienna&#x2019;s coffeehouses, using a special piano with one keyboard for the hands and another for the feet; European virtuoso Henri Herz entertaining rowdy miners during the California gold rush; Beethoven at his piano, conjuring healing angels to console a grieving mother who had lost her child; Liszt fainting in the arms of a page turner to spark an entire hall into hysterics. Here is the instrument in all its complexity and beauty. We learn of the incredible craftsmanship of a modern Steinway, the peculiarity of specialty pianos built for the Victorian household, the continuing innovation in keyboards including electronic ones. And most of all, we hear the music of the masters, from centuries ago and in our own age, brilliantly evoked and as marvelous as its most recent performance.<br> &nbsp;<br> With this wide-ranging volume, Isacoff gives us a must-have for music lovers, pianists, and the armchair musician.</p><p><b>Stuart Isacoff</b>, a pianist and writer, was the founder of <i>Piano Today</i> magazine, which he edited for nearly three decades.

The instrument had long been a trusted companion-sparking early dreams, conferring a place in the history books, and easing his way in a world of racial strife. Now, at eighty- one, he looked worn out. Arriving at the stage of New York's Birdland in a wheelchair, after debilitating strokes had weakened his legs and slowed his left hand, he struggled to move his heavy frame onto the piano bench.<br><br>Yet, as soon as the keyboard was within reach, even before his torso had completed its fall into a seated position, he thrust out his right arm and grabbed a handful of notes; at that signal, the bass player, drummer, and guitarist launched into their first number. And suddenly there was that sound. He still had it-a musical personality as large as life, steeped in tradition yet recognizably, unmistakably all its own.<br><br>For decades, Peterson's technical command and musical instincts had instilled in others the kind of awe and fear he expressed about his idol, the late Art Tatum. He once compared that older piano master to a lion: an animal that scares you to death, though you can't resist getting close enough to hear it roar. (Classical firebrands Sergei Rachmaninoff and Vladimir Horowitz went to hear Tatum perform and came away with the same sense of intimidation.) And that made his comeback all the more difficult.<br><br>The Peterson style was always characterized by rapid, graceful, blues- tinged melody lines unfurled in long, weaving phrases with the inexorable logic of an epic narrative; and, equally important, a visceral sense of rhythm, transmitted with fire and snap. Those qualities for which he was renowned-effortless fluidity and clockwork precision-were not merely aspects of his playing; they were the very foundation on which his artistic expression rested. And pulling them off required the highest level of athletic prowess.<br><br>At times that evening in 2006, in one of the few scheduled performances on what would turn out to be his farewell tour to the world, flashes of the old brilliance emerged, unscathed by illness and time. Yet the strain was also clear. No matter: playing was for him as necessary as eating and breathing. "That's my therapy," he said after the set, nodding in the direction of the piano as a small smile inched across his half-frozen visage. But in the memorable moments during his set, the large, glistening, ebony B�sendorfer that filled most of Birdland's stage meant something even greater than his personal salvation; for everyone in that room, it became the center of the universe.<br><br>It's a role the piano has enjoyed for over three hundred years: luring music lovers to Parisian salons to hear Chopin's plaintive improvisations, and to Viennese concert halls for Beethoven's ferocious, string-snapping outbursts. The piano captured the spotlight at Harlem "rent parties," where two-fisted ivory "ticklers" worked furiously to outshine each other, and consoled lonely miners in the California Gold Rush as roving European virtuoso Henri Herz performed his variations on "Oh Susannah" [sic] for them. It comforted thousands of Siberian peasants who never had heard a note of classical piano music until Russian master Sviatoslav Richter brought it to their doorsteps. It is still capable of wowing crowds in concert halls, clubs, and stadiums the world over.<br><br>But the piano is more than just an instrument; in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, it is a "wondrous box," filled as much with hopes, yearnings, and disappointments as with strings and hammers and felt. It has been a symbol as mutable as the human condition, representing refined elegance in a Victorian home and casual squalor in a New Orleans brothel.<br><br>Consider the gamut of emotions, from elation to dread and even to terror, a performer may face in conquering its technical hurdles, as the young woman in Nobel Prize-winner Elfriede Jelinek's novel The Piano Teacher learned: "She gathers all her energy, spreads her wings, and then plunges forward, toward the keys, which zoom up to her like the earth toward a crashing plane. If she can't reach a note at first swoop, she simply leaves it out. Skipping notes, a subtle vendetta against her musically untrained torturers, gives her a tiny thrill of satisfaction."<br>THE CRUELTY OF THE PIANO-by Piotr Anderszewski<br><br>When I play with orchestra, I sometimes tell myself I'll never play a concerto again. Too many artistic compromises. I only want to do recitals.<br><br>When I'm confronted with the extreme loneliness of the recital, the heroism and also the cruelty involved, I sometimes think that I'll never do recitals ever again. From now on I'll only make recordings.<br><br>When I'm recording and am free to repeat the work as often as I wish, the possibility of doing better, of giving the best possible performance and where everything can turn against me, the piano, the microphone, and above all my own sense of freedom, I think to myself, I'll never go into a recording studio ever again. It's even more cruel. In fact, the ultimate temptation would be to stop everything, lie down, listen to the beat of my heart and quietly wait for it to stop_._._.<br><br>[Yet] sometimes I may not want to play at all, but upon striking the final chord, I say to myself, Something happened here. Something that is completely beyond my control. It's as if the audience had co- created something with me. That's life. Giving is receiving.<br><br>FROM THE BRUNO MONSAINGEON FILM Piotr Anderszewski: Unquiet Traveller<br><br>Nevertheless, the piano can also exert an almost mystical attraction, seducing devotees into lifelong bonds. The magic, when it happens, is inexplicable. Even the technicians who maintain the piano's working parts can seem at times like initiates in a mysterious cult. "A tuner makes a good husband," claims a character in Daniel Mason's novel The Piano Tuner. "He knows how to listen, and his touch is more delicate_._._._Only the tuner knows the inside of the piano."<br><br>Those innards are a miracle of invention. With wood and cast iron, hammers and pivots, weighing altogether nearly a thousand pounds-and capable of sustaining twenty-two tons of tension on its strings (the equivalent of about twenty medium-sized cars)-this majestic contraption will whisper, sing, stutter, or shout at the will of the player. Its tones range from the lowest notes of the orchestra to the highest. It has the remarkable ability to express music of any time period, and in any style-Baroque fugues, Romantic reveries, Impressionist sketches, church hymns, Latin montunos, jazz rhythms, and rock riffs. In the process, it makes everything its own.<br><br>THE WONDER OF THE PIANO by Menahem Pressler<br><br>I was recently asked by Indiana University, where I teach, to select a new piano, and I found one that I felt was exceedingly beautiful. I've chosen many pianos over the years, and most of the time there were some colleagues who complained about my selection, saying, "It's not brilliant enough," or "It's not for chamber music," or "It's not for solo performance." It's like when you choose your mate and someone else says, "I would never have married her." But this time it seemed that I had selected the Marilyn Monroe of pianos-everyone loved it.<br><br>The other night I was playing the Schubert B-flat Sonata on it, and the piano was like a living soul. This was at the end of the day, and I was very tired. And yet I was reminded of what a happy man I am playing on such a piano. You become elated, invigorated, and inspired_._._._all through something built by a factory. It tells me that there is more to life than we can see.<br><br>At birdland, Oscar Peterson again proved the instrument's enduring power. By the end of the evening he had the crowd on its feet, cheering and whistling. It was a special moment, and the audience knew it, the culmination of a unique career, and a last chance to experience the Peterson style, crafted by melding many of the disparate strands that ran through the piano's history. His artistry encompassed them all.<br><br>For dazzling technique, he followed the lessons of the European classical tradition, culled from childhood sessions in his native Canada, first with his sister, Daisy, then with local pianist Louis Hooper and the Hungarian teacher Paul de Marky. He was so serious about his lessons as a young boy that he would practice for up to eighteen hours at a time, he said, on days "when my mother didn't drag me off the stool." De Marky was a good model: he had studied in Budapest with Stefan Thom�n, who had studied with the great Franz Liszt-a musical titan of his day and the founder of modern piano technique.<br><br>Liszt's phenomenal facility-in trademark rapid-fire passages and streams of double notes, along with other exciting displays, such as the quick alternation of hands on the keyboard (which, he explained, he had taken from the music of J. S. Bach)-created such a sensation that poet Heinrich Heine described him in 1844 as "the Attila, the scourge of God." Indeed, claimed Heine, audiences should take pity on the pianos, "which trembled at the news of his coming and now writhe, bleed and wail under his hands, so that the Society for the Protection of Animals should investigate them." Liszt's musical tricks had made many of the breathtaking piano feats of Art Tatum possible. (Peterson was so flabbergasted when he first heard Tatum on record that he almost retired on the spot. "I still feel that way," he admitted that evening at Birdland.)<br><br>De Marky trained Peterson in that great tradition, and assigned the pianist other staples of the repertoire, such as Chopin's treacherously difficult Etudes, along with the "big, rich soft chords" (harmonies, or simultaneously sounding tones) of Claude Debussy. "Oscar is our Liszt and Bill Evans is our Chopin," commented composer Lalo Schifrin, referring to the popular conception that Liszt conquered the piano while Chopin seduced it.<br><br>It's only partly true: the dreamy, impressionist character of a Bill Evans performance does suggest comparisons with the hushed, poetic approach of Chopin, who, according to witnesses, played the instrument using a dynamic range that fell somewhere between a whisper and a murmur. Yet the intricate melodies spun out in an Oscar Peterson solo also owe a great deal to the lyrical genius of Chopin, a composer whose "irregular, black, ascending and descending staircases of notes," wrote critic James Huneker, could "strike the neophyte with terror." And as he taught Peterson, Paul de Marky homed in on Chopin's most important trait. "I don't hear the melody singing," he would tell his student. "The melody is choppy. Make it sing." And so the works of the celebrated classical composers-great improvisers, all-served as his training ground.<br><br>Peterson's immersion in classical studies made him an easy target for some of the jazz crowd. Writer Leonard Feather, using the pseudonym Prof. S. Rosentwig McSiegel, authored a lampoon about a technically astounding pianist named Peter Oscarson who dumbfounded other musicians at a concert by playing a "somewhat esoteric interlude, a set of quadrilles and French-Canadian folk songs." But those studies with de Marky put him in good stead for the artistic heights that would come.<br><br>Paul de Marky's classical expertise notwithstanding, he also encouraged Oscar Peterson's immersion in the jazz canon. "Mr. de Marky was a very great pianist and teacher," remembered Peterson. "What I loved about him was that he was not shortsighted. He was a fantastic classical pianist. But I would come to him for a lesson, and he'd be playing jazz records"-greats like Teddy Wilson, Nat "King" Cole, and Duke Ellington. "Their playing served as my rudiments," he reported.<br><br>He was swept into almost instant fame when producer Norman Granz, visiting Canada, heard him in a live radio broadcast in 1949, and soon after coaxed him into playing in a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert at Carnegie Hall in New York. Introduced as a surprise guest performer, no sooner did he take the stage than, as Mike Levin reported in the magazine DownBeat, the event was stopped "dead cold in its tracks." According to Levin, "he scared some of the local modern minions by playing bop ideas in his left hand_._._._Whereas some of the bop stars conceive good ideas but sweat to make them, Peterson rips them off with an excess of power." Reminiscing about that time, Peterson revealed that he had decided the only way to get attention was "to frighten the hell out of everybody pianistically." He did, and the Peterson-Granz partnership was cemented. The two ended up touring across the continent together, building larger and larger audiences, while battling the pervasive racial prejudice they encountered along the way.<br><br>That American debut helped Peterson move beyond an early reputation as an expert in the rhythmically charged, perpetual- left-hand-motion technique of boogie-woogie. After winning a Canadian amateur contest in the style when he was just fourteen, he became known for a while as "the Brown Bomber of Boogie-Woogie," a takeoff on the nickname given to boxer Joe Louis. ("That was RCA Victor's idea, not mine," Peterson recalled with a glint of anger. "They insisted that I do that. As for whatever name they gave me, I'm happy not to remember.")<br>JAZZ VS. THE CLASSICS<br><br>Oscar Peterson was not, of course, the only jazz great with a classical foundation. Even Louis Armstrong, whose sound seemed hatched from the streets and sporting houses of New Orleans without a hint of European influence, spoke of studying the classics as a child in the city's Colored Waif's Home for Boys. "I played all classical music when I was in the orphanage," he recalled. "That instills the soul in you. You know? Liszt, Bach, Rachmaninoff, Gustav Mahler, and Haydn." Pianist Lil Hardin, who eventually married Armstrong, had been a classical-music major at Nashville's Fisk University before she joined the Creole Jazz Band. She found the transition a bit of a challenge, however. "When I sat down to play," she said, "I asked for the music and were they surprised! They politely told me they didn't have any music and furthermore never used any: I then asked what key would the first number be in. I must have been speaking another language because the leader said, 'When you hear two knocks, just start playing.' " She did, they hired her, and her life as a jazz musician was launched.<br><br>Leonard Feather was just having a little fun with his "Peter Oscarson" portrait. Yet, even today, it's easy to find "experts" guilty of such silly pigeonholing. Ironically, just at the time the "original instrument" movement in classical music was reaching the conclusion that the quest for absolute stylistic authenticity in the performance of early works was futile, the leadership of Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York was attempting to frame the parameters of "authentic" jazz, as if a sort of purity test were possible. But Whitney Balliett got it right when he wrote that jazz was "the sound of surprise." It thrives on unlimited possibility, not hidebound categories.</p><h2>A Lover of Unreason: The Biography of Assia Wevill</h2><p>&#39;Assia was my true wife, and the best friend I ever had&#39;, wrote Ted Hughes, after his lover surrendered her life and that of their young daughter in 1969, six years after Sylvia Plath had suffered a similiar fate.

Grant and the Politics of War and Reconstruction, 1861-1868 (Civil War America)</h2><p>Historians have traditionally drawn distinctions between Ulysses S. Grant's military and political careers. In <i>Let Us Have Peace</i>, Brooks Simpson questions such distinctions and offers a new understanding of this often enigmatic leader. He argues that during the 1860s Grant was both soldier and politician, for military and civil policy were inevitably intertwined during the Civil War and Reconstruction era. According to Simpson, Grant instinctively understood that war was 'politics by other means.' Moreover, he realized that civil wars presented special challenges: reconciliation, not conquest, was the Union's ultimate goal.

SO ROUND AND WHITE AND pulsing with movement.<br> <br>Like the tiny mouth and nasal openings.<br> <br>Ignoring the maggot masses, I inserted gloved fingers beneath the small torso and gently lifted one shoulder. The baby rose, chin and limbs tucked tight to its chest.<br> <br>Flies scattered in a whine of protest.<br> <br>My mind took in details. Delicate eyebrows, almost invisible on a face barely recognizable as human. Bloated belly. Translucent skin peeling from perfect little fingers. Green-brown liquid pooled below the head and buttocks.<br> <br>The baby was inside a bathroom vanity, wedged between the vanity&#x2019;s back wall and a rusty drainpipe looping down from above. It lay in a fetal curl, head twisted, chin jutting skyward.<br> <br>It was a girl. Shiny green missiles ricocheted from her body and everything around it.<br> <br>For a moment I could only stare.<br> <br>The wiggly-white eyes stared back, as though puzzled by their owner&#x2019;s hopeless predicament.<br> <br>My thoughts roamed to the baby&#x2019;s last moments. Had she died in the darkness of the womb, victim of some heartless double-helix twist? Struggling for life, pressed to her mother&#x2019;s sobbing chest? Or cold and alone, deliberately abandoned and unable to make herself heard?<br> <br>How long does it take for a newborn to give up life?<br> <br>A torrent of images rushed my brain. Gasping mouth. Flailing limbs. Trembling hands.<br> <br>Anger and sorrow knotted my gut.<br> <br>Focus, Brennan!<br> <br>Easing the miniature corpse back into place, I drew a deep breath. My knee popped as I straightened and yanked a spiral from my pack.<br> <br>Facts. Focus on facts.<br> <br>The vanity top held a bar of soap, a grimy plastic cup, a badly chipped ceramic toothbrush holder, and a dead roach. The medicine cabinet yielded an aspirin bottle containing two pills, cotton swabs, nasal spray, decongestant tablets, razor blades, and a package of corn-remover adhesive pads. Not a single prescription medication.<br> <br>Warm air moving through the open window fluttered the toilet paper hanging beside the commode. My eyes shifted that way. A box of tissue sat on the tank. A slimy brown oval rimmed the bowl.<br> <br>I swept my gaze left.<br> <br>Lank fabric draped the peeling window frame, a floral print long gone gray. The view through the dirt-crusted screen consisted of a Petro-Canada station and the backside of a d�panneur.<br> <br>Since I entered the apartment, my mind had been offering up the word &#x201c;yellow.&#x201d; The mud-spattered stucco on the building&#x2019;s exterior? The dreary mustard paint on the inside stairwell? The dingy maize carpet?<br> <br>Whatever. The old gray cells kept harping. Yellow.<br> <br>I fanned my face with my notebook. Already my hair was damp.<br> <br>It was nine A.M., Monday, June 4. I&#x2019;d been awakened at seven by a call from Pierre LaManche, chief of the medico-legal section at the Laboratoire de sciences judiciaires et de m�decine l�gale in Montreal. LaManche had been roused by Jean-Claude Hubert, chief coroner of the province of Quebec. Hubert&#x2019;s wake-up had come from an SQ cop named Louis B�dard.<br> <br>According to LaManche, Caporal B�dard had reported the following:<br> <br>At approximately two-forty A.M. Sunday, June 3, a twenty-seven-year-old female named Amy Roberts presented at the H�pital Honor�-Mercier in Saint-Hyacinthe complaining of excessive vaginal bleeding. The ER attending, Dr. Arash Kutchemeshgi, noted that Roberts seemed disoriented. Observing the presence of placental remnants and enlargement of the uterus, he suspected she had recently given birth. When asked about pregnancy, labor, or an infant, Roberts was evasive. She carried no ID. Kutchemeshgi resolved to phone the local S�ret� du Qu�bec post.<br> <br>At approximately three-twenty A.M., a five-car pileup on Autoroute 20 sent seven ambulances to the H�pital Honor�-Mercier ER department. By the time the blood cleared, Kutchemeshgi was too exhausted to remember the patient who might have delivered a baby. In any case, by then the patient was gone.<br> <br>At approximately two-fifteen P.M., refreshed by four hours of sleep, Kutchemeshgi remembered Amy Roberts and phoned the SQ.<br> <br>At approximately five-ten P.M., Caporal B�dard visited the address Kutchemeshgi had obtained from Roberts&#x2019;s intake form. Getting no response to his knock, he left.<br> <br>At approximately six-twenty P.M., Kutchemeshgi discussed Amy Roberts with ER nurse Rose Buchannan, who, like the doctor, was working a twenty-four-hour shift and had been present when Roberts arrived. Buchannan recalled that Roberts simply vanished without notifying staff; she also thought she remembered Roberts from a previous visit.<br> <br>At approximately eight P.M., Kutchemeshgi did a records search and learned that Amy Roberts had come to the H�pital Honor�-Mercier ER eleven months earlier complaining of vaginal bleeding. The examining physician had noted in her chart the possibility of a recent delivery but wrote nothing further.<br> <br>Fearing a newborn was at risk, and feeling guilty about failing to follow through promptly on his intention to phone the authorities, Kutchemeshgi again contacted the SQ.<br> <br>At approximately eleven P.M., Caporal B�dard returned to Roberts&#x2019;s apartment. The windows were dark, and as before, no one came to the door. This time B�dard took a walk around the exterior of the building. Upon checking a Dumpster in back, he spotted a jumble of bloody towels.<br> <br>B�dard requested a warrant and called the coroner. When the warrant was issued Monday morning, Hubert called LaManche. Anticipating the possibility of decomposed remains, LaManche called me.<br> <br>So.<br> <br>On a beautiful June day, I stood in the bathroom of a seedy third-floor walk-up that hadn&#x2019;t seen a paintbrush since 1953.<br> <br>Behind me was a bedroom. A gouged and battered dresser occupied the south wall, one broken leg supported by an inverted frying pan. Its drawers were open and empty. A box spring and mattress sat on the floor, dingy linens surrounding them. A small closet held only hangers and old magazines.<br> <br>Beyond the bedroom, through folding double doors&#x2014;the left one hanging at an angle from its track&#x2014;was a living room furnished in Salvation Army chic. Moth-eaten sofa. Cigarette-scarred coffee table. Ancient TV on a wobbly metal stand. Chrome and Formica table and chairs.<br> <br>The room&#x2019;s sole hint of architectural charm came from a shallow bay window facing the street. Below its sill, a built-in tripartite wooden bench ran to the floor.<br> <br>A shotgun kitchen, entered from the living room, shared a wall with the bedroom. On peeking in earlier, I&#x2019;d seen round-cornered appliances resembling those from my childhood. The counters were topped with cracked ceramic tile, the grout blackened by years of neglect. The sink was deep and rectangular, the farmhouse style now back in vogue.<br> <br>A plastic bowl on the linoleum beside the refrigerator held a small amount of water. I wondered vaguely about a pet.<br> <br>The whole flat measured maybe eight hundred square feet. A cloying odor crammed every inch, fetid and sour, like rotting grapefruit. Most of the stench came from spoiled garbage in a kitchen waste pail. Some came from the bathroom.<br> <br>A cop was manning the apartment&#x2019;s only door, open and crisscrossed with orange tape stamped with the SQ logo and the words Acc�s interdit&#x2014;S�ret� du Qu�bec. Info-Crime. The cop&#x2019;s name tag said Tirone.<br> <br>Tirone was in his early thirties, a strong guy gone to fat with straw-colored hair, iron-gray eyes, and apparently, a sensitive nose. Vicks VapoRub glistened on his upper lip.<br> <br>LaManche stood beside the bay window talking to Gilles Pomier, an LSJML autopsy technician. Both looked grim and spoke in hushed tones.<br> <br>I had no need to hear the conversation. As a forensic anthropologist, I&#x2019;ve worked more death scenes than I care to count. My specialty is decomposed, burned, mummified, dismembered, and skeletal human remains.<br> <br>I knew others were speeding our way. Service de l&#x2019;identit� judiciaire, Division des sc�nes de crime, Quebec&#x2019;s version of CSI. Soon the place would be crawling with specialists intent on recording and collecting every fingerprint, skin cell, blood spatter, and eyelash present in the squalid little flat.<br> <br>My eyes drifted back to the vanity. Again my gut clenched.<br> <br>I knew what lay ahead for this baby who might have been. The assault on her person had only begun. She would become a case number, physical evidence to be scrutinized and assessed. Her delicate body would be weighed and measured. Her chest and skull would be entered, her brain and organs extracted and sliced and scoped. Her bones would be tapped for DNA. Her blood and vitreous fluids would be sampled for toxicology screening.<br> <br>The dead are powerless, but those whose passing is suspected to be the result of wrongdoing by others suffer further indignities. Their deaths go on display as evidence transferred from lab to lab, from desk to desk. Crime scene technicians, forensic experts, police, attorneys, judges, jurors. I know such personal violation is necessary in the pursuit of justice. Still, I hate it. Even as I participate.<br> <br>At least this victim would be spared the cruelties the criminal justice machine reserves for adult victims&#x2014;the parading of their lives for public consumption. How much did she drink? What did she wear? Whom did she date? Wouldn&#x2019;t happen here. This baby girl never had a life to put under the microscope. For her, there would be no first tooth, no junior prom, no questionable bustier.<br> <br>I flipped a page in my spiral with one angry finger.<br> <br>Rest easy, little one. I&#x2019;ll watch over you.<br> <br>I was jotting a note when an unexpected voice caught my attention. I turned. Through the cockeyed bedroom door, I saw a familiar figure.<br> <br>Lean and long-legged. Strong jaw. Sandy hair. You get the picture.<br> <br>For me, it&#x2019;s a picture with a whole lot of history.<br> <br>Lieutenant-d�tective Andrew Ryan, Section de crimes contre la personne, S�ret� du Qu�bec.<br> <br>Ryan is a homicide cop. Over the years, we&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time together. In and out of the lab.<br> <br>The out part was over. Didn&#x2019;t mean the guy wasn&#x2019;t still smoking hot.<br> <br>Ryan had joined LaManche and Pomier.<br> <br>Jamming my pen into the wire binding, I closed my spiral and walked to the living room.<br> <br>Pomier greeted me. LaManche raised his hound-dog eyes but said nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dr. Brennan.&#x201d; Ryan was all business. Our MO, even in the good times. Especially in the good times.<br> <br>&#x201c;Detective.&#x201d; I stripped off my gloves.<br> <br>&#x201c;So. Temperance.&#x201d; LaManche is the only person on the planet who uses the formal version of my name. In his starched, proper French, it comes out rhyming with &#x201c;France.&#x201d; &#x201c;How long has this little person been dead?&#x201d;<br> <br>LaManche has been a forensic pathologist for over forty years and has no need to query my opinion on postmortem interval. It&#x2019;s a tactic he employs to make colleagues feel they are his equals. Few are.<br> <br>&#x201c;The first wave of flies probably arrived and oviposited within one to three hours of death. Hatching could have begun as early as twelve hours after the eggs were laid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty warm in that bathroom,&#x201d; Pomier said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty-nine Celsius. At night it would have been cooler.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So the maggots in the eyes, nose, and mouth suggest a minimum PMI of thirteen to fifteen hours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Though some fly species are inactive after dark. An entomologist should determine what types are present and their stage of development.&#x201d;<br> <br>Through the open window, I heard a siren wail in the distance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rigor mortis is maximal,&#x201d; I added, mostly for Ryan&#x2019;s benefit. The other two knew that. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s consistent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rigor mortis refers to stiffening due to chemical changes in the musculature of a corpse. The condition is transient, beginning at approximately three hours, peaking at approximately twelve hours, and dissipating at approximately seventy-two hours after death.<br> <br>LaManche nodded glumly, arms folded over his chest. &#x201c;Placing possible time of death somewhere between six and nine o&#x2019;clock last night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The mother arrived at the hospital around two-forty yesterday morning,&#x201d; Ryan said.<br> <br>For a long moment no one spoke. The implication was too sad. The baby might have lived over fifteen hours after her birth.<br> <br>Discarded in the cabinet? Without so much as a blanket or towel? Once more I pushed the anger aside.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m finished,&#x201d; I said to Pomier. &#x201c;You can bag the body.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded but didn&#x2019;t move away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the mother?&#x201d; I asked Ryan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Appears she may have split. B�dard is running down the landlord and canvassing the neighbors.&#x201d;<br> <br>Outside, the siren grew louder.<br> <br>&#x201c;The closet and dresser are empty,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There are few personal items in the bathroom. No toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re assuming the heartless bitch bothered with the niceties of hygiene.&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced at Pomier, surprised by the bitterness in his tone. Then I remembered. Pomier and his wife had been trying to start a family. Four months earlier she&#x2019;d miscarried for the second time.<br> <br>The siren screamed its arrival up the street and cut off. Doors slammed. Voices called out in French. Others answered. Boots clanged on the iron stairs leading to the first floor from the sidewalk.<br> <br>Shortly, two men slipped under the crime scene tape. Uniform jumpsuits. I recognized both: Alex Gioretti and Jacques Demers.<br> <br>Trailing Gioretti and Demers was an SQ corporal I assumed to be B�dard. His eyes were small and dark behind wire-rimmed glasses. His face was blotchy with excitement. Or exertion. I guessed his age to be mid-forties.<br> <br>LaManche, Pomier, and I watched Ryan cross to the newcomers. Words were exchanged, then Gioretti and Demers began opening their kits and camera cases.<br> <br>Face tense, LaManche shot a cuff and checked his watch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Busy day?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Five autopsies. Dr. Ayers is away.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you prefer to get back to the lab, I&#x2019;m happy to stay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps that is best.&#x201d;<br> <br>In case more bodies are found. It didn&#x2019;t need saying.<br> <br>Experience told me it would be a long morning. When LaManche was gone, I glanced around for a place to settle.<br> <br>Two days earlier I&#x2019;d read an article on the diversity of fauna inhabiting couches. Head lice. Bedbugs. Fleas. Mites. The ratty sofa and its vermin held no appeal. I opted for the window bench.<br> <br>Twenty minutes later, I&#x2019;d finished jotting my observations. When I looked up, Demers was brushing black powder onto the kitchen stove. An intermittent flash told me Gioretti was shooting photos in the bathroom. Ryan and B�dard were nowhere to be seen.<br> <br>I glanced out the window. Pomier was leaning against a tree, smoking. Ryan&#x2019;s Jeep had joined my Mazda and the crime scene truck at the curb. So had two sedans. One had a CTV logo on its driver&#x2019;s-side door. The other said Le Courrier de Saint-Hyacinthe.<br> <br>The media were sniffing blood.<br> <br>As I swiveled back, the plank under my bum wobbled slightly. Leaning close, I spotted a crack paralleling the window wall.<br> <br>Did the middle section of the bench function as a storage cabinet? I pushed off and squatted to check underneath.<br> <br>The front of the horizontal plank overhung the frame of the structure. Using my pen, I pushed up from below. The plank lifted and flopped back against the windowsill.<br> <br>The smell of dust and mold floated from the dark interior.<br> <br>I peered ...</p><h2>Grids &amp; Guides: 3 Notepads for Visual Thinkers (3 designs in blue, green, red, tear-off sheets, 50 sheets each, 6 x 9 in): 3 Notepads for Visual ... tear-off sheets, 50 sheets each, 6 x 9 in)</h2><p>Sketch, catalog, plot, thumbnail, dream, and develop with these three distinctive, colorful tablets&#x2014;a companion to our bestselling <em>Grids &amp; Guides</em> Notebook.

As children, especially as young children, we are too busy actually growing up to be able to put this experience into the distanced and interpretive frames of language and narrative. Not only are the great stories about childhood always written by adults looking back, remembering, perhaps inventing, perhaps fantasizing, but childhood itself might best be understood as an adult construct, a retrospective adult project. For starters, what would be the language of childhood? The French writer Georges Bernanos, late in his life, seeking to visualize the entry of his soul into the afterlife, saw himself as child-"l'enfant que je fus"-as the deadest of his dead, yet leading the way, even though irretrievable. And on the far side of words. Is it too much to claim that language itself is the price we pay for leaving childhood, the conversion of wonder into grammar? Or could we, alternatively, see language as prize, as central attainment and means of empowerment in the process of growing up?<br><br>These matters are at once primitive and abstruse. Anyone who has seen the vibrancy of children at play senses the gap (in beauty and power) between "being" and "speaking." And that may be the least of it, for language also heralds a regime of deferral and translation. The immediacy of experience is exchanged for the mediation of words. We exit the Garden into a realm of signs. Consider, in this regard, the young Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who saw his fundamental life crisis in just these colors. Retelling his life from the vantage point of age and retrospect (in Les Confessions), Rousseau recalls the life- altering episode of a stolen comb. A stolen comb? Yes, stealing a comb is what the child is wrongly accused of doing, but when he passionately argues that he is innocent, he is not believed. You may ask: Where's the crisis? I repeat: He says he is innocent, he is not believed. This is no less than the entry into language as facticity, language as unreliable conduit. "There ended the serenity of my childish life," he writes; words are a broken bridge, our hearts cannot be read.<br><br>But the other side of this equation is no less crucial: language as empowerment, language as means of comprehension and agency, language as indispensable tool for growing up. We will have occasion to see that the most "successful" figures in my study, the ones who manage best to make their way into life, whether it be by overcoming adversity or understanding the nature of culture (the culture that contains them), enlist words as one of their chief resources. We will see this writ large, as it were, in the trials and exploits of figures like the p�caro Pablos, Faulkner's Ike McCaslin, and Alice Walker's Celie.<br><br>Further, what would we know about the lives of others if it were not for the written record, the vital transcription of experience into language? Our most precious accounts of childhood, of the experience of growing up and making our way, come to us by way of writing. Writing not only ensures the communication of this key phase of life, it is the tool that enables us to give shape and meaning to it, to retrace it, to convert its quicksilver into cadences and form. Writing eludes (as nothing else does) time's entropy and erasure, so that the depicted childhood of, say, Rousseau or Dickens or Proust still shimmers in its immediacy (and in its mix of terrors and errors) while those men's bones moulder in the earth. But that is the least of it: the stories of growing up, bequeathed to us by literature, partake of the miraculous plenitude proper to narrative: they are big with time, awash in culture, so that they yield an echoing script that not only captures the child's experience but also signals much more: the gathered familial and cultural vectors whose weave inhabits the mind of the child and the foreboding temporal curve to come, as the child leaves childhood and enters the adult scheme. Through the narratives of childhood, the accounts of the voyage from morning to noon, we access something no photo, no single utterance can express: at once an unfolding of human potential and a peculiar map of private and public destiny, interwoven.<br><br>Childhood: Romantic Construct?<br><br>And more still: we see, thanks to the optic of these books, the elemental shock that the adult world, with its peculiar rituals, routinely inflicts on the young, and this is tonic, for it is what we adults have stopped perceiving for some time now. Aided, we now see the ticket we bought long ago for admission to "reality." As readers, as thinkers, as folks with miles to go before we sleep, we're already positioned on the far side of this dividing line, ousted from innocence and locked into experience, as William Blake would have put it, but for a precious while-as we negotiate, say, the poetry of Blake himself or the novels of Dickens, Twain, and Faulkner-we breathe another air and grope toward an earlier self. Literature restores to us the most moving chapter of our life-the truly kinetic time when everything was mobile, the time before things made adult sense, perhaps the only time things actually made real sense.<br><br>Or did they? It is well known that our current ideas about childhood as precious are profoundly inflected by the tenets of Romanticism, which did much to single out that special time of life as special: unspoiled, innocent, closer to nature, formative, holding in potential all that we might conceivably become or destroy. This discovery of the purity and preciousness of children is doubtless related as well to the increasing socioeconomic exploitation of them as it occurred in the Industrial Revolution of precisely that time period, as if to show that the value of young lives only becomes visible when those same lives are at risk and under attack. (Blake provokes along just these lines.) Here would be a belatedness hardwired into our thinking: it is damage that instructs.<br><br>But go further back than nineteenth-century Romanticism, and you find nothing so sweet or so value-laden. There was no mystique about children then. Their (virtually invisible) fates could be arduous indeed. As we saw, Oedipus the King traces such a fate, but Sophocles is not interested in child measures, only in adult measures. One is struck, in reading literature from antiquity to the nineteenth century, by the harshness and marginality of children's lives, and it seems essential to pay heed, today, to those earlier, sterner accounts. Shakespeare and the authors of the seventeenth-century picaresque and baroque tales and eighteenth-century writers such as Abb� Pr�vost and Pierre Choderlos de Laclos had little interest (or belief) in angelic children, nor did they believe that the child was "father to the man," as William Wordsworth famously put it in the following century. Even later writers who believed in the sanctity of children-the Bront� sisters, Dickens, Dostoevsky, Twain, Ibsen- surprise us with their findings, not merely about the vicious treatment children often received but also about their liabilities, vices, and blind spots. Of course, moderns such as Kafka, Faulkner, Ralph Ellison, and Toni Morrison and figures of our own moment are acutely aware of the ideological forces that not only beset children but also "compose" them, bleed into them as the work of culture, thus making us see that the consciousness of children is inflected by all manner of things beyond their ken.<br><br>Age of Children<br><br>In examining the suite of growing-up stories to come, many of them brutal and dark, I am concerned with illuminating the coming-of-age drama that each contains. Coming of age is of course a conceptual as well as somatic or temporal proposition, and we rightly see it as a kind of education, a movement toward understanding and maturity. What kind of education, understanding, and maturity? That is what these materials so richly display. Let me first clarify that my terms "childhood" and "old age" are not strictly age-specific. Faulkner's Benjy (in The Sound and the Fury) is only a few years younger (thirty- three) than Joyce's Leopold Bloom (in Ulysses), who is all of thirty- eight, yet I regard Benjy as a child and Bloom as man growing old. My reasons are simple: Benjy is constructed as an idiot who possesses no powers of ratiocination and is thus permanently infantilized, but Bloom sees himself as crucially past his prime, mindful of a more vibrant but long-gone past, obliged to find gratification via substitution. Each depiction is wise in lessons for us, regarding how life is parsed at distinct phases of our trajectory. Indeed, each is cued to a past that cannot be recaptured, but Benjy does not know this and Bloom does. One is permanently arrested on the front side of life, whereas the other reflects incessantly on his belatedness. We see (frozen) childhood and (reflective) old age in these postures.<br><br>Yet I am all too aware that growing up and growing old can-indeed, must-coexist in each of us, and that sense of tandem has a special pathos of its own as we go through life remembering and experiencing and taking stock. Finally, many of us who get to old age may find that we are still children or, worse, made into children, infantilized, either by culture or by senility. So if childhood is not a calendar truth, what is it? What follows are some of the generic features that shape and cohere the story of growing up.<br><br>Rubrics for the Narrative of Growing Up<br><br>Innocence (and Experience)<br><br>William Blake titled two major poetry collections Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, and nothing, I believe, stamps the perceptual drama of growing up more profoundly than this crucial binary. These two radically different lenses make visible how fatefully perspective shapes what we make of our lives. One thinks, initially, that we all move from innocence to experience (with whatever happy or catastrophic results that may occur), but it is no less true that we move from experience to innocence, inasmuch as experience alone makes prior innocence visible. Yet innocence also makes visible, which is what Blake's greatest poems show us. "Out of the Mouths of Babes" is, like its folkloric sibling, "The Emperor's New Clothes," a window onto human foible and distortion or masquerade. It cannot surprise us that many of the books we most love move along such axes, often signaling in both directions: the child records more than he or she can know, while the sense-making of retrospect sifts and takes measures of what has occurred. Maybe that old Sphinx who tested Oedipus knew that every life is ultimately on four feet, two feet, and three feet, at the same time.<br><br>If Blake's disturbing poems exploit innocence as optic, the great German novel of the seventeenth century, Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen's Simplicissimus, appearing more than a century before Romantic conceptions of childhood set in, is still more brutal in its use of naivet� as lens. Once again the optics are double-the book counts on us to "know" what its character does not-but this earlier text widens the stage immeasurably beyond Blake's late-eighteenth- century London, giving us a rare sense of what "history" (bloody history) might look like at "ground zero," prior to all abstractions. This shattering account of a simpleton's experience of the Thirty Years' War, written by a man who was there, reads almost like an allegory of the soul: how can it preserve its purity and integrity in a time of horror? The novel's punch comes from its angle of vision: to render the convulsive antics of a world out of control, as perceived by an unknowing victim.<br><br>We continue our investigation of innocence as lens with Twain's much- beloved Huckleberry Finn. Twain enlists the vision and voice of a school dropout, an uneducated boy with zero cultural capital, to tell the story at hand. What would slavery look like to such a person? The novel's grandeur is to be found in the evolving moral education of Huckleberry Finn as he gradually, fitfully, registers the humanity of Jim, the runaway slave whom he is helping to free, who becomes his figurative father. Huck faces a shockingly modern dilemma, a dilemma no child escapes: can one possibly get clear of the dictates of mainstream ideology, especially if those dictates are lodged inside one's head and go by the name of conscience?<br><br>Faulkner's Benjy is my next and, arguably, supreme instance of innocence as vision. The Sound and the Fury obliges us to negotiate the jumbled perceptions of a mind that is completed unfurnished, along cognitive lines, while the emotions rise and fall and careen in roller- coaster fashion, as he responds to the sole and enduring tragedy of his life: Caddy (his sister) is not there (in reality) but is always there (in his heart). Benjy is one of the grand readerly challenges in modern literature, but this is not some intellectual puzzle; rather, his responses to life write large for us the fate of love: our need, its beauty, its loss.<br><br>I want to conclude this discussion of childhood innocence by examining one of the most endearing characters of contemporary literature, the little girl Marjane, the protagonist of Marjane Satrapi's poignant graphic novel Persepolis, which depicts a female child's coming-of-age drama in Tehran in the fateful years between the shah's expulsion and the beginning reign of the ayatollahs. A daughter of privilege, good- hearted but politically unaware, Marjane not only registers the Iranian change of regime but also embodies the dynamic of a young girl moving toward adolescence, and this combination of forces at once personal and ideological achieves a surprising pathos and poetry in the graphic format.<br><br>In all five instances-Blake, Grimmelshausen, Twain, Faulk?ner, Satrapi- the eyes and voice of the unknowing child become our conduit toward knowledge, toward a shock of recognition: this, we understand, is what exploitation, war, racism, terrorism, and even love actually look like, feel like. We may have known those terms forever, but we have never envisioned the world from this angle, never put on these particular glasses, never inhabited this position. A curtain goes up, and the innocent child is our teacher.<br><br>Experience (and Innocence)<br><br>Experience is the name we give to what life either shows us or does to us. At the opposite pole from innocence, it is the tally sheet that records our actual passing through, and as such, it is in frequent warfare with the expectations of innocence. All coming-of-age stories negotiate these two poles, as if they made up a magnetic field that the young traverse. Experience almost always has a pedagogical tinge to it-"this is what life has taught me" or "this is what it really was like"-and its greatest virtue is its open-eyed, unflinching acknowledgment of things as they are, rather than as they might or should be. In this light, it will be seen that our greatest works of art record the gradual accumulation of experience on the part of the young, as if the task of narrative were to put them on time's treadmill and then show what they encounter and how they alter. Here is the schooling of life itself, an education often at odds with the precepts that are drilled into us by culture.</p><h2>Emma</h2><p>For New condition books in our store; You will be the first user.

Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Major Pettigrew&#39;s Last Stand: A Novel</h2><p><b>Written with a delightfully dry sense of humour and the wisdom of a born storyteller, <i>Major Pettigrew's Last Stand</i> explores the risks one takes when pursuing happiness in the face of family obligation and tradition.</b><br><br>When retired Major Pettigrew strikes up an unlikely friendship with Mrs. Ali, the Pakistani village shopkeeper, he is drawn out of his regimented world and forced to confront the realities of life in the twenty-first century. Brought together by a shared love of literature and the loss of their respective spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship on the cusp of blossoming into something more. But although the Major was actually born in Lahore, and Mrs. Ali was born in Cambridge, village society insists on embracing him as the quintessential local and her as a permanent foreigner. The Major has always taken special pride in the village, but will he be forced to choose between the place he calls home and a future with Mrs. Ali?</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2010</strong>: In her witty and wise debut novel, newcomer Helen Simonson introduces the unforgettable character of the widower Major Ernest Pettigrew.&nbsp; The Major epitomizes the Englishman with the "stiff upper lip," who clings to traditional values and has tried (in vain) to pass these along to his yuppie son, Roger. The story centers around Pettigrew's fight to keep his greedy relatives (including his son) from selling a valuable family heirloom--a pair of hunting rifles that symbolizes much of what he stands for, or at least what he thinks he does. The embattled hero discovers an unexpected ally and source of consolation in his neighbor, the Pakistani shopkeeper Jasmina Ali. On the surface, Pettigrew and Ali's backgrounds and life experiences couldn't be more different, but they discover that they have the most important things in common. This wry, yet optimistic comedy of manners with a romantic twist will appeal to grown-up readers of both sexes. Kudos to Helen Simonson, who distinguishes herself with <em>Major Pettigrew's Last Stand</em> as a writer with the narrative range, stylistic chops, and poise of a veteran. <em>--Lauren Nemroff</em><br>Helen Simonson was born in England and spent her teenage years in a small village in East Sussex.

He lives in Scotland.</p>My dearest friend, Two more days have passed, days during which, as always, I have been subjected to new, astonishing, strange and inexplicable experiences. However, for the moment I will continue with my description of the events immediately following my arrival. The street I told you about, the one I wanted to cross, was an avenue. On either side of the cobbled carriageway is a wretched, neglected strip of grass. The stones, too, have been set in the road in a very slipshod manner, making it pretty bumpy. If the Exalted Son of Heaven had driven along this street just once, he would immediately have had the mandarin in charge of road construction beheaded. In the strips of grass there are ugly, unkempt trees growing. All unsuspecting, I was just starting to cross this avenue when I heard an unimaginable roaring, grinding, rattling noise approach; there is simply no comparison for it in our world. At the same time a huge animal or a fiery demon, that was the thought that flashed through my mind came rushing towards me at lightning speed; no, even faster than lightning, so incredibly fast that I could not see the animal or thing at all. Since then I have found out, more or less, what these things are (they aren&#x2019;t demons, though they are at least as dangerous as demons are for superstitious people) but on that first day I was naturally completely unprepared. I was half-way across the road when, as I assumed, this snorting beast noticed me. Everything happened in the time it takes a bat to beat its wings. I realised that the demon was not after me. It made an even more hideous roaring noise, if possible, and tried to avoid me. I too tried to get out of the way and, with a couple of bounds, reached the safety of the bridge. But, like a wild boar in a frenzied charge, the animal (bigger than ten wild boars) could not change direction so quickly. Still roaring, then making a bang such as you would only get if you set off the whole Imperial stock of fireworks for the New Year&#x2019;s celebrations at once, the demon, so it seemed to me, leapt up a tree. I collapsed to the ground and fainted. By the time I regained consciousness an even greater crowd of bignoses had gathered, and again each one looked like the next.</p><h2>College Algebra &amp; Trigonometry, 6th Edition</h2><p>Hardcover College Algebra &amp; Trigonometry textbook. 6th Edition.

Their tribe has moved and escaped for thousands of years- across oceans, deserts, and mountains-but now, it seems, there is nowhere else to go. Danger is imminent in every direction, yet the territory of imagination and belief is limitless. At the suggestion of an eleven-year-old girl and a mysterious stranger who has washed up on the riverbank, the villagers decide to reinvent the world: deny any relationship with the known and start over from scratch. Destiny is unwritten. Time and history are forgotten. Jobs, husbands, a child, are reassigned. And for years, there is boundless hope. But the real world continues to unfold alongside the imagined one, eventually overtaking it, and soon our narrator-the girl, grown into a young mother-must flee her village, move from one world to the next, to find her husband and save her children, and propel them toward a real and hopeful future. A beguiling, imaginative, inspiring story about the bigness of being alive as an individual, as a member of a tribe, and as a participant in history, <i>No One Is Here Except All Of Us</i> explores how we use storytelling to survive and shape our own truths. It marks the arrival of a major new literary talent.</p><p><p></p><strong>Tea Obreht interviews Ramona Ausubel</strong>.<p></p> <p><strong>Tea Obreht</strong> is the author of <strong>The Tiger&#x2019;s Wife</strong>, a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and National Book Award finalist. Here she talks with novelist Ramona Ausubel about her experiences writing <i>No One is Here Except All of Us</i>.</p> <p><strong> T�a Obreht:</strong> I&#x2019;m always interested in how projects of this magnitude begin. It seems like a novel &#x201c;about&#x201d; one&#x2019;s family, or projecting one&#x2019;s family into a fictional sphere, almost always ends up being an endeavor of self-discovery. Tell me a little bit about how you came to it, about what inspired you to take this journey and why.</p> <p><strong>Ramona Ausubel:</strong> The project started out as a desire to record the family stories while my grandmother was still alive and well (happily, she remains so at ninety-one). I didn&#x2019;t know it would become a novel until later, when, having collected dozens of individual stories, I was frustrated that the complete picture was still foggy. It felt like having a lot of scraps of fabric, but if I wanted to see the quilt, I was going to have to sew it myself.</p> <p><strong>Obreht: </strong> So much of this incredible book relies on fable, on the creation and acceptance of a particular reality in order to survive. At the end of the book, in a note to the reader, you even say &#x201c;facts aren&#x2019;t important&#x201d; and that &#x201c;the truth is in the telling.&#x201d; What draws you to this idea of fable? What is its place in the modern world?</p> <p><strong>Ausubel:</strong> When I first started writing, I was trying to stick as closely to the &#x201c;facts&#x201d; as possible. Soon, I realized that facts were not what I really cared about. The reason it mattered to my grandmother to tell the story and the reason it mattered to me to hear it and tell it again was not that we were trying to reconstruct history, it was that we were trying to fold the characters, places and lives from the past into our world. As long as a story is being told, it stays alive, even as it changes. Each fable is a version of what <i>could</i> have happened, and between all those versions, maybe we come close to the truth. I think that, no matter how modern our world gets, we will always have a need to tell stories about the past.</p> <p><strong>Obreht:</strong> I was fascinated by the point of view shifts in <i>No One Is Here Except All Of Us</i>; it seems that the novel begins rooted in collective consciousness and then, as the experiment of isolation fails, and tragedy upon tragedy is unleashed onto the characters, this shared perspective splits up until, in an ironic twist, outside communication becomes the only way the characters receive fragmented information about each others&#x2019; lives. Why did you choose this particular narrative style? How did you settle on Lena as the primary voice?</p> <p><strong>Ausubel:</strong> It took many drafts to find the right point-of-view for this story. Lena is based on my great-grandmother and I knew she would be the protagonist, but I wanted it to be about everyone together as well, for there to be a kind of Greek chorus. Finally, I decided to give the story to Lena to tell, and to allow her to speak both for the village and for herself, to speak to the ideas of collective struggle and imagination in addition to one person&#x2019;s loneliness and isolation.</p> <p><strong>Obreht:</strong> This novel was obviously inspired by family legends, but tell me more about your own life as a writer. When did you know you wanted to write? Who are some of your literary influences?</p> <p><strong>Ausubel:</strong> I have wanted to write for as long as I can remember. My mom recently came across the poems I wrote in fifth grade, and I was a little embarrassed to admit that not only did I recall writing them, but I had been so proud of them that I still had them memorized twenty years later. I still feel the same sense of excitement and satisfaction when a piece of writing starts to come alive.</p> <p>Some authors and books that matter to me are <i>Pastoralia</i>, by George Saunders, <i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</i>, by Michael Chabon, <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, <i>Gilead</i> by Marilyn Robinson and <i>Florida</i> by Christine Schutt.</p> <p><strong> Obreht:</strong> You already have numerous illustrious publications under your belt, but <i>No One Is Here Except All Of Us</i> is your first novel. What were some of the challenges you had to overcome, and what surprised you most about the process?</p> <p><strong>Ausubel:</strong> I have written short stories that mattered a lot to me, but writing this book was different because I spent so many hours in the world of the novel--some days I spent more time there than I did in the real world. Though the characters are different from the relatives on whom they are based, I still feel that I got to know my ancestors in a way I never could have otherwise. Those old family stories became my own, and they became part of my everyday life.</p> <p>In November, I became a mother. As I gaze down at my new baby, a tiny, beautiful little boy, I think, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re here. I have so many stories to tell you,&#x201d; and I realize that in many ways I have been writing this novel for him.</p> <p>(Photo of T�a Obreht � Beowulf Sheehan)</p> <p>(Photo of Ramona Ausubel � Twin Lens Images)</p><b>Ramona Ausubel</b> is a graduate of the MFA program at the University of California, Irvine.

But in order for that big picture to impact your daily life, giving you the right attitude to face every joy and trial, you need to set aside a little time each day to remember it, or, as St. Paul wrote, to &#34;set your mind on things above&#34; (Col 3:2).

This book, opening with these words, presents an entirely new theory of the process of design. </p><p> In the first part of the book, Mr. Alexander discusses the process by which a form is adapted to the context of human needs and demands that has called it into being. He shows that such an adaptive process will be successful only if it proceeds piecemeal instead of all at once. It is for this reason that forms from traditional unselfconscious cultures, molded not by designers but by the slow pattern of changes within tradition, are so beautifully organized and adapted. When the designer, in our own self-conscious culture, is called on to create a form that is adapted to its context he is unsuccessful, because the preconceived categories out of which he builds his picture of the problem do not correspond to the inherent components of the problem, and therefore lead only to the arbitrariness, willfulness, and lack of understanding which plague the design of modern buildings and modern cities. </p><p> In the second part, Mr. Alexander presents a method by which the designer may bring his full creative imagination into play, and yet avoid the traps of irrelevant preconception. He shows that, whenever a problem is stated, it is possible to ignore existing concepts and to create new concepts, out of the structure of the problem itself, which do correspond correctly to what he calls the subsystems of the adaptive process. By treating each of these subsystems as a separate subproblem, the designer can translate the new concepts into form. The form, because of the process, will be well-adapted to its context, non-arbitrary, and correct. </p><p> The mathematics underlying this method, based mainly on set theory, is fully developed in a long appendix. Another appendix demonstrates the application of the method to the design of an Indian village. </p><p></p></p><p>Christopher Alexander has outlined an ambitious proposal that could revolutionize the approach to architectural design...His method cannot help but become &#34;a very powerful tool indeed&#34; for those who would deal with projects of the complex present and the growing complexity of the future. One of the most important contemporary books about the art of design, what it is, and how to go about it. An important book for the urban designer and planner... stimulating and certainly controversial...It may one day prove to be a landmark in design methodology. The success or failure of the designed environment will remain, as always, a human responsibility...Alexander&#39;s assertions are not only challenging and stimulating but informative.</p><h2>Civilized Man&#39;s Eight Deadly Sins</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, the Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Four Agreements are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be impeccable with your word&lt;br&gt;Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid speaking against yourself &lt;br&gt;or gossiping about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#x2019;t take anything personally&lt;br&gt;Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won&#x2019;t be the victim of needless suffering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#x2019;t make assumptions&lt;br&gt;Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Always do your best&lt;br&gt;Your best keeps changing from moment to moment; it is different when you are healthy rather than sick. Simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self abuse, and regret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p><p>Sit at the foot of a native elder and listen as great wisdom of days long past is passed down. In <i>The Four Agreements</i> shamanic teacher and healer Don Miguel Ruiz exposes self-limiting beliefs and presents a simple yet effective code of personal conduct learned from his Toltec ancestors. Full of grace and simple truth, this handsomely designed book makes a lovely gift for anyone making an elementary change in life, and it reads in a voice that you would expect from an indigenous shaman. The four agreements are these: Be impeccable with your word. Don't take anything personally. Don't make assumptions. Always do your best. It's the how and why one should do these things that make <i>The Four Agreements</i> worth reading and remembering. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>Don Miguel Ruiz was born into a family of healers, and raised in rural Mexico by a curandera (healer) mother and a nagual (shaman) grandfather. The family anticipated that Miguel would embrace their centuries-old legacy of healing and teaching, and carry forward the esoteric Toltec knowledge. Instead, distracted by modern life, Miguel chose to attend medical school and become a surgeon. A near-death experience changed his life. Stunned by this experience, he began an intensive practice of self-inquiry. He devoted himself to the mastery of the ancient ancestral wisdom, studying earnestly with his mother, and completing an apprenticeship with a powerful shaman in the Mexican desert. In the tradition of the Toltecs, a nagual guides an individual to personal freedom. don Miguel is a nagual from the Eagle Knight lineage, and is dedicated to sharing his knowledge of the teachings of the ancient Toltecs. He is the author of The Four Agreements, The Mastery of Love, and The Four Agreements Companion Book.

James Walsh spent two years as a &#x201c;salt&#x201d; in two casinos in South Florida, working as a buffet server and a bartender. Neither his employers nor the union knew of Walsh&#x2019;s intentions to write about his experience. Now he reveals hard-won and little-known truths about how unions fight to organize service workers, the vigorous corporate opposition against them, and how workers get caught in the middle.<br> <br>As a salt, Walsh witnessed the cultish nature of labor organization and was constantly grilled by his union organizer as to whether he had enough grit and determination to win converts to the cause while remaining undercover. At work, Walsh witnessed the oddities of casino life and management&#x2019;s stunning mistreatment of service industry employees, most of whom were hanging on to economic survival by their fingernails. His meticulous reporting reveals supervisors berating workers for the smallest infractions, even as employees submit to relentless scrutiny, ever-changing work schedules, and the callous behavior of casino customers.<br> <br>A clear-eyed and balanced account, <i>Playing Against the House</i> explores the trials of day-to-day life for the working poor and the face of twenty-first-century union organizing and union busting in unprecedented detail.</p><p>James Walsh&#x2019;s work has appeared on the websites of <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, and <i>GlobalPost</i>. He is on the editorial staff at <i>New York</i> magazine. <i>Playing Against the House</i> is his first book."The degreeof commitment shown by this young author is stunning. James Walsh used his two years in low wage jobs to help bring a union fight to casino owners and, now, an original, first-hand account to readers. It's an up-close, empathetic portrait of the working poor, in particular the bravest among them, and what happens when idealism meets the sausage-making of union organizing." &#x2014;<b>Ted Conover, author of <i>Rolling Nowhere</i> and <i>Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;James Walsh&#x2019;s <i>Playing Against the House</i> is a brilliantly conceived and executed undercover expose about union rights at casinos. Set in South Florida, the narrative is full of compassion for the hard-working poor. Every page sizzles. This is New Journalism at its finest!&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Douglas Brinkley, author of <i>Cronkite</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;James Walsh has done a remarkable thing here. He has told a story of 21st-century union organizing, not through statistics and received wisdom, but through riveting, accessible first-person reporting. He humanizes the issue, deftly rendering everyone involved&#x2014;from workers to management&#x2014;and in the process, has created a necessary text that also happens to be a page-turner.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Dave Eggers, cofounder of Voice of Witness and author of <i>The Circle</i> and <i>A Hologram for The King</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With a balanced perspective and sharp eye, he reveals the tactics managers use to keep employees from unionizing. The book sketches in the history and politics of Florida's multibillion dollar casino industry, which is reliant on slot machines. It also examines casino culture, showing how Walsh's black coworkers were treated differently from white ones by both employers and customers. In an informative and gripping narrative, Walsh moves from the tactics of covert union organizing to the court case that will determine whether Mardi Gras employees who were fired for unionizing will regain their jobs. Walsh gives an insider's view of the gaming industry, placing the stories and struggles of his coworkers at the heart of this must-read book.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Walsh does an engagingly readable job of humanizing the labor battle, showing just how much power the corporations wield and how long they can wait.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Kirkus</i></b></p><h2>Advanced Theta Healing: Harnessing the Power of All That Is</h2><p>Title: Advanced ThetaHealing( Harnessing the Power of All That Is) &lt;&gt;Binding: Paperback &lt;&gt;Author: ViannaStibal &lt;&gt;Publisher: HayHouse</p><p>Vianna Stibal is an artist, writer, teacher and intuitive reader.

Why did he suffer so much? What has this to do with me? Finally, who sent him to his death? The answer to the last question is that God did. Jesus was God&#39; s Son. The suffering was unsurpassed, but the whole message of the Bible leads to this answer.Why did Christ suffer and die? The central issue of Jesus&#39; death is not the cause, but the meaning- God&#39; s meaning. That is what this book is about. John Piper has gathered from the New Testament fifty reasons.

She presents 250-plus color illustrations of examples from the Southwest Museum's collection, together with 57 details of the works and 49 historical photographs. She also includes accounts of the early collectors and some of the colorful people who were involved in the founding of the museum and the shaping of its collection. The accompanying CD-ROM contains charts of the fiber and construction analysis performed on each of the textiles, as well as a complete inventory of the museum's holdings. Oversize: 10.25x12.25&lt;"&gt;. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>Kathleen Whitaker is the Director of the Indian Arts Research Center at the School of American Research in Santa Fe, New Mexico.For the Navajo and Pueblo, weaving is far more than a craft or even an art form, it's a spiritual endeavor. Anthropologist Whitaker, director of the Indian Arts Research Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico, presents brief but thoroughly grounding histories of their weaving traditions, explicating their cosmic implications and demanding techniques. She also gratefully records the 1907 founding of the Southwest Museum by Charles Fletcher Lummis, the repository for an extraordinary and unparalleled collection of southwestern American Indian textile arts dating from 1800 and moving forward in time, the source of the magnificent pieces displayed so vibrantly here in more than 300 thread-sharp, deeply hued color photographs, many of which fill entire pages in this handsome, large-format volume. Ponchos, serapes, shoulder blankets, dresses, all are identified by date, place of creation (if known), patterns, and dye and thread sources, technical elements bolstered by photographs circa 1900 of weavers at work. Certain design motifs are called eyedazzlers, a designation appropriate, metaphorically, for every work of art exhibited here, spellbinding weavings that vibrate with nothing less than the power of prayer. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

That left the Five Civilized Tribes&#x2014;Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks, and Seminoles&#x2014;essentially under Confederate jurisdiction and control. <i>The American Indian and the End of the Confederacy, 1863&#x2013;1866</i>, spans the closing years of the Civil War, when Southern fortunes were waning, and the immediate postwar period.&nbsp;Annie Heloise Abel shows the extreme vulnerability of the Indians caught between two warring sides. "The failure of the United States government to afford to the southern Indians the protection solemnly guaranteed by treaty stipulations had been the great cause of their entering into an alliance with The Confederacy, "she writes. Her classic book, originally published in 1925 as the third volume of <i>The Slaveholding Indians</i>, makes clear how the Indians became the victims of uprootedness and privation, pillaging, government mismanagement, and, finally, a deceptive treaty for reconstruction.</p><p>Annie Heloise Abel (1873&#x2013;1947) was a historical editor and writer of books dealing mainly with the trans-Mississippi West.

But when she accidentally dislodges an envelope concealed in Julien's desk, she finds an enigmatic note from a stranger and feels compelled to meet this woman who might hold the key to Julien's past.

She lives with her husband in Coral Gables, Florida, and they spend part of each year in India and France. <i>Haunting Paris</i> is her first novel.<p>They call us revenants, those who return. Restless for this world, we pass each other in mute recognition, for to be silent and solitary is our essential condition. But death doesn&#x2019;t end our thirst for a human touch, a human voice calling our name.</p><p>And so I haunt these familiar quays, this familiar river. Music drifts down from Sylvie&#x2019;s window and I linger until it comes to an end. The scent of lilacs on the breeze stirs dormant phantoms to life, but music is sorcery more potent; though bound to time&#x2019;s measure, it exists on a plane beyond time, where there is no past and no future, there is only the present in which the dead revisit this world.</p><p>Night after night I wait until the last notes fade away and Sylvie comes to the window at last. I retreat into the shadows as one after another the beautiful mansions along quai d&#x2019;Anjou spring to light, transforming those in the gloom below into a throng of ghosts. Occasionally a passing figure pauses in a pool of lamplight, to light a cigarette or glance at a watch.</p><p>Squandered time! The most enduring of regrets. In the end, a lifetime is not enough, the heart yearns for more. Who can reason with desire?</p><p>The heart has its reasons that reason cannot know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sylvie stirs uneasily in her sleep. Hearing a noise next door, she thinks it must be Julien working late, trying hard not to wake her though he knows she can sleep through anything. The sleep of the just, he says. Ch�ri, she calls out. Coco barks and she realizes of course it can&#x2019;t be Julien, it must be the Americans. Though her body wakes into the present, it takes her mind a few moments longer to absorb the shock of knowing that she will never hear Julien&#x2019;s voice again.</p><p>So the Americans are here finally, much later than expected. A good thing she had left the key downstairs with Ana Carvalho; the concierge is agog with curiosity about them. Sylvie herself plans to stop by in the morning, see that they&#x2019;re properly settled in. Not too early, though, they must be tired after the long flight from Florida, how long did Fabienne say it was, nine hours, ten? It never seemed to bother her friend, but then Fabienne was a force of nature. She had pushed Sylvie to divide the large apartment in two, and before the paint was even dry she had located Sylvie&#x2019;s first renters, a couple of professors from her college. With Fabienne nothing is moderato, everything always presto, prestissimo.</p><p>At one time Sylvie would have panicked at the prospect of dealing with strangers, but now her shyness seems the relic of a vanished self. When she was a child, her parents often acted surprised that they had produced someone with her shrinking temperament, and Fabienne said if schoolgirls had sobriquets like kings, she would be Sylvie la timide. The nickname had stuck to her through school, but when she mentioned it to Julien, he smiled and said that on the contrary, to him she was Sylvie, coeur de lion.</p><p>Sighing deeply, Sylvie turns over in bed. Seeing her unconcerned about the intruders, Coco tucks his head down into his paws. Sylvie has a harder time going back to sleep and wishes now she hadn&#x2019;t thrown away the pills that brought her respite from the sleepless nights when she paced the apartment till dawn. During the nuits blanches of the past winter, she had considered visiting Fabienne in America, had even booked a ticket at her urging. But in the end she had backed out because she couldn&#x2019;t bear to leave Julien behind. Not so lionhearted after all.</p><p>Yes, you are, Julien insists, encouraging even in death.</p><p>For so long she had felt as if the brightly lit banquet of life was being carried on behind closed doors, and she was entitled only to crumbs from the feast, not to a place at the table. She had felt it again at the house on rue de Bi�vre, when Isabelle had seated her next to Julien. Then one day Isabelle&#x2019;s husband had risen from that table because of her.</p><p>Julien&#x2019;s love had turned her life into a vista of open doorways, like the grand enfilade at the neighboring H�tel de Lauzun. Sylvie could not remember what her life had been before him, nor imagine what it would be after. But she no longer has to imagine it, she lives every day with his absence.</p><p>Even the smallest thing is a painful reminder that she will never see him again. A few days ago, when she and Ana Carvalho were moving Julien&#x2019;s desk from his study, they jostled open a secret drawer and a folder fell out to the floor. The concierge was beside herself with excitement about the discovery, but the shock of it hit Sylvie like a blow. She could not explain why she felt there was something fateful about it, though it looked no different from the stacks of such folders with his case notes filed away at Maison Chenizot. But when she opened it, she found a checkbook from an unknown bank and a sealed envelope with the initial M. Without a word, Sylvie quietly replaced the folder in the desk.</p><p>Opening the envelope or going through the checkbook feels like a trespass, something forbidden, as if Julien has sealed off part of the life they inhabited together and left her forlorn outside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On their side of the apartment, Will throws open the door to the terrace. Alice is already under the covers, but he stays up for a while to shake off the irritations of travel--a delayed flight, a damaged suitcase--and wonders how Alice remains unruffled by it all.</p><p>At least the apartment on �le Saint-Louis has turned out better than he expected, none of the ghastly patterned wallpaper the French seem to love. But Fabienne had assured him it was a bonne adresse, one of the best in Paris, on the very street where Baudelaire created his imaginary paradise, luxe, calme, et volupt�. She had also confided her hopes that their being on the premises would draw Sylvie out of her shell; she&#x2019;s become quite reclusive since Julien&#x2019;s death last fall.</p><p>Will wonders how exactly she expects them to lead a stranger out of her grief. They&#x2019;ll do what they can, of course, for Fabienne&#x2019;s sake, if nothing else. Amazing the way she had arranged the trip for them, even scoring some coveted tickets for the bicentennial parade. His misgivings suddenly vanish as he steps out to the terrace and sees the lights of the city spread before him, brightness rising like mist off a river.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My curiosity about the Americans is too mild to make me linger in their company. It&#x2019;s only by coming into Sylvie&#x2019;s orbit that they have attracted my attention at all. But she is now asleep and I hasten away, lest I trouble her dreams.</p><p>As a professional interpreter of dreams, there was one I encountered repeatedly: &#x201c;All of a sudden I came across an unfamiliar door in my house, and my heart was beating loudly as I pushed it open and discovered a whole new wing, a secret part of the house where I had lived all this time unknowing, unsuspecting.&#x201d; Though I never had that particular dream myself, it&#x2019;s what death felt like to me, an unfamiliar door in a familiar house, which I pushed open to find myself forever outside.</p><p>In this twilight world between the living and the dead, I walk till the sky lightens from black to cobalt, my favorite hour, the blue hour, when the blur of mystery still clings to things, a mystery that the sun will burn off soon enough to reveal them as plain as day. I am tired, yet it is not fatigue, for the ailments of the body have been shrugged off like a cumbersome garment. But weariness does not belong to the body alone, and it is then, when I am past caring or thinking or feeling, that the buildings around me dissolve into ruined castles on a hill and the haze over the city is like the burning vines in winter, while far off I hear the mournful howl of wolves.</p><p>At the sound of footsteps behind me I spin around and find myself ambushed. Familiar faces transformed by hatred spit out the age-old curse: Sale juif! Then a rock strikes me sharply across the temple and blood gushes from my eye. I am shocked by the taste, warm and coppery. But when I raise my hand to touch my face, there is no blood. Yet the pain, I feel it still under the cobalt sky, where for a moment the centuries stay their ceaseless glissade. Then the sun resumes its unrelenting course as I look around to find castles and fires and wolves all fled, and I am alone again, no longer a man but a ghost in a ravishing city where all that remains of what was once my life are some spectral ruins, which I try to piece together like the vanishing fragments of a dream.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though it&#x2019;s not yet light outside, Sylvie forces herself to get up, to boil water, measure coffee into the press. She closes her eyes, and Julien comes up the stairs with a brioche from the boulangerie. Ch�rie, he says, and she holds out her arms, but there&#x2019;s no one there, no warm and steady hand, no aroma of fresh bread. Blinking away tears, she pours the coffee, which she has made too bitter. She swallows it with a grimace, reminding herself to stock up on provisions; she doesn&#x2019;t want another scolding from Ana Carvalho about how poorly she eats.</p><p>She goes downstairs with Coco trotting ahead, his tail wagging excitedly, as if the morning walk is an unexpected treat instead of a daily occurrence. Watering the plants in the courtyard, the concierge calls out, &#x201c;So your Americans have come, Madame Sylvie.&#x201d;</p><p>Your Americans. Sylvie smiles and shrugs. The Taylors are people she has never seen before, and after this summer will likely never see again. Perhaps there will be a thank-you note, then a Christmas card, then silence.</p><p>Sylvie is disappointed that Fabienne herself won&#x2019;t be coming this summer. At the faculty concert someone told me, &#x201c;Break a leg,&#x201d; which I promptly did, she&#x2019;d wired, but luckily the cello suffered no damage, the insurers say it&#x2019;s worth a lot more than I am. She wishes Fabienne had never moved to America. Now, more than ever, she feels the need of her friend&#x2019;s presence, someone who knows her so well that she can offer comfort just by being there, without saying a word.</p><p>Returning from her walk, Sylvie goes up to her landing and draws a deep breath. Best to get it over with sooner rather than later. Fabienne had assured her the Taylors were both sympa, but nice or not, Sylvie doesn&#x2019;t expect to see much of them after this; she has put in a separate entrance so they can come and go as they please. She knocks on their door, and as soon as it opens, Coco trots into the apartment, sniffing the room with a proprietary air. His black eyes glint with interest at the strangers. The first human touch the dog had known was a man trying to drown him, but he does not hold that against people in general, considering them for the most part capable of kindness. He goes right up to Alice and rests his wiry head trustfully against her knee, puzzled at first by the different layout of the room. Madame&#x2019;s piano is not in its accustomed place, nor Monsieur&#x2019;s desk. But Coco is philosophical about change. He knows that as long as there is a table, scraps will fall.</p><p>Sylvie notices the delicacies she had put out for them--pastries from G�rard Mulot, confitures from Mariage Fr�res--are untouched. Not fond of sugar, the Americans. Well, she&#x2019;ll know better next time. After a few pleasantries, Sylvie leaves them to their breakfast and returns to her own side of the apartment. She waits until she hears the Taylors go out, then sits down at the piano, the music on the stand turned to Schubert&#x2019;s last sonata. The beautiful opening melody ripples like light on water, but then an ominous trill sounds the dark undercurrent of loss. The notes blur before her eyes and Sylvie plays on from memory, tears rolling down her cheeks until Coco can bear it no longer and jumps on the stool to lick her face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Making her way up to Sylvie&#x2019;s, the concierge encounters the Americans on the landing and stops to size them up in the broad light of day, her curiosity unsatisfied by a brief glimpse the night before. At least the man speaks fluent French, what a relief, she needn&#x2019;t break her jaw with English.</p><p>Everything about the Americans shines, their teeth, their nails, their skin; do they scrub themselves daily with pumice? And naturally they&#x2019;ve got on tennis shoes, Americans wear them everywhere, even indoors. Ana Carvalho has watched many American programs on television and considers herself an expert on their peculiarities. No wonder they all come to Paris on holiday, what is there for them to do at home, nothing but autoroutes everywhere and wild creatures running loose on the streets. Armadillos. No, that&#x2019;s Texas, these people are from Florida. Alligators, then, and sharks, which explains why they&#x2019;re all bristling with guns. Thankfully, there&#x2019;s nothing like that at the beach in Hossegor, where she goes for her own vacation.</p><p>Ana Carvalho hopes their presence won&#x2019;t d�range Madame Sylvie too much, but on the other hand, a little bother might shake her out of her misery. At least she&#x2019;s no longer wild with grief; the look in Sylvie&#x2019;s eyes after Monsieur Julien&#x2019;s passing had given Ana quite a turn. Many a time she had gone upstairs to make sure Sylvie was all right, to keep her company through the dark watches of the night. Hopefully, that phase is over, but even if she no longer fears the worst, Ana still frets about Sylvie, the way she&#x2019;s shut herself up in the apartment like an old woman, as if fifty-three is any age at all, a mere girl compared to herself, long past retirement age and still working her fingers to the bone.</p><p>Ana enters Sylvie&#x2019;s apartment and finds her sitting in the dark. Oh l� l� l� l�, not again. It&#x2019;s enough to sink anyone&#x2019;s spirits, playing lugubrious music all day long. And that little dog listening at her feet, it&#x2019;s a wonder he hasn&#x2019;t succumbed to melancholy as well. Give her a gay little tune, something to set one&#x2019;s feet tapping. &#x201c;Quand on s&#x2019;prom�ne (pum pum) au bord de l&#x2019;eau,&#x201d; she sings as she puts on a pot of coffee, &#x201c;comme tout est beau (pum), quel renouveau (pum).&#x201d; Now that&#x2019;s a song, and sure enough, Coco is up on his hind legs, didn&#x2019;t she say he was musical? She&#x2019;d taught him to dance like that, by holding a biscuit just out of reach. A cowering little mite he was then, but look at him now, ready to take on anything, even the great big Rott down the street.<br><br></p></p><h2>Metric Pattern Cutting</h2><p>The first major new edition of this bestselling textbook since 1985.

Steele again sets the stage for an epic battle, played out in Alaska, Russia, Switzerland, and ultimately Jerusalem, pitting the protectors of paradise&#x2014;the eternal angels&#x2014;against the &#x201c;goons&#x201d; of timeless evil. As the forces engage, we find the former escort Katherine Taylor having somehow survived the hideous scorched-earth attack on her Pacific Northwest home, but with no other signs of life in sight. Katherine soon realizes that her memory has been wiped clean, with few clues whether her toddler, Max, the child of prophecy who will guide creation through the next stage of evolution, has been killed or captured. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Meanwhile, Detective Jay Harper is once again at Lausanne Cathedral, where he is following a new directive from his immortal, heavenly central command: rescue both Katherine and Max before the goons eliminate all trace of goodness from the world at midnight. What unfolds is a thrill-packed, action-filled journey that spans the globe&#x2014;and the heavens. Combining science, religion, and fantasy, <i>The Way of Sorrows</i> is a wildly imaginative, inventive, one-of-a-kind finale to Jon Steele&#x2019;s monumental trilogy.</p><p>JON STEELE is an award-winning journalist and author of <i>The Watchers</i> and <i>Angel City</i>.

They lived an ascetic life, abstained from animal sacrifice in religious practices, and performed good works on behalf of the afflicted.

Modern archaeologists and historians agree the church was erected over the ground where Romans crucified seditionists and criminals, and that most probably Jesus was crucified somewhere within the walls of the church in AD 36. However, there is no credible archaeological or historical evidence that Jesus was buried there.</p><p><b>The Dome of the Rock </b>(built in AD 691) is the Islamic shrine that stands atop Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is built over the site of the Second Temple of ancient Israel (destroyed by Rome in AD 70). Together with Al-Aqsa Mosque, also atop Temple Mount, the Dome of the Rock marks the third holiest site in Islam. It stands over what is known as the &#x201c;Foundation Stone.&#x201d; This stone is sacred to all three of the Abrahamic faiths. Jews believe it to be the place where Abraham nearly slaughtered his son Isaac in a test of faith as commanded by God. Christians revere the stone as a place where Jesus prayed in the time of the Second Temple. Muslims believe the stone to be the place from where Mohammed ascended to heaven.</p><p><b>The Third Temple </b>(to be built in the time of the Messiah) was prophesied in the Book of Ezekiel and has yet to be built. Jews believe the Third Temple will provide a dwelling place for God to return and live among His people again. Messianic Christians believe the building of the Third Temple marks the &#x201c;end of days,&#x201d; when Jesus will return to officiate the Final Judgment. Construction of the Third Temple would require the destruction of Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock.</p><p><b>The exact year and circumstances of Yeshua ben Yosef&#x2019;s death </b>are not clearly known. For the sake of this story, the author has drawn on archaeological and historical evidence as presented by Dr. Shimon Gibson in his work <i>The Final Days of Jesus</i>. Also, the author has chosen to denote historical dates as BC and AD instead of BCE and CE.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PERFECTUM</p><p>In the name of the Pure G-d.</p><p>These words are written many years after the destruction of Jerusalem, which came on the ninth day of Av, 3830. Know that I am a son of the light who served the teacher of righteousness at Qumran near the Salt Sea. Our settlement stood three parsa&#x2019;ot in distance from Jericho, which is also now destroyed. The destruction of Qumran came on the twenty-fifth day of Sivan, three years after the fall of Jerusalem. It came at the hands of the Tenth Legion Fretensis of Rome, who marched along the Salt Sea to conquer the Zealots at Masada and so end the Jewish revolt.</p><p>This is how it happened.</p><p>On the twenty-first day of Sivan, Roman outriders reached the summit of the mountain that separated us from Jericho&#x2019;s ruins. In doing this they discovered our commune on the plateau below them. The outriders observed us through the afternoon and left before sunset. In those hours they learned we had no fortifications or weapons of any kind. Four days had passed when a great cloud of dust rose from the desert and there was the clamor of boots and drums. Then appeared the vanguard of the Tenth Legion leading more than five thousand soldiers onto the Masada Road. Their helmets and lances caught the dawn and their shields bore the color of blood. By this sign we knew our sacrifice was at hand, as it had been prophesied to us by seven angels of the Pure G-d. And so it was that upon reaching the trail that climbed the plateau to our commune, the main body of the legion continued south while the fifth cohort of infantry and archers broke away to attack Qumran.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>As this prophecy came to pass, and being the youngest of my order, I was instructed by the teacher of righteousness to take refuge in the cavern of solitude, which is set apart from the commune. It was a scriptorium for transcriptions of the holiest scrolls as judged by the teacher. Here, one of the chosen scribes would live alone for many days in proper meditation before writing the holy name of the Pure G-d.</p><p>I was young and had yet to be selected for this duty, though I longed to assume it. So it was with sadness that my ascension to the cavern was not as one of the chosen scribes but to bear witness to the annihilation of my order, and then live a life of isolation to the end of my days. Within the cavern were a bed, a table and stool, lamps, and sacred oil to burn for light. There were quills and ink-making tools and sheets of fine vellum. There were food stocks in jars and a cistern outside the cavern&#x2019;s entrance that gathered rain as it flowed from the mountains.</p><p>This duty was commanded of me by the teacher of righteousness so that one of our number might survive and continue to watch for the man of signs and wonders, who would come to reclaim the things entrusted to us by the seven angels of the Pure G-d. For the seven did know this man and guarded his tomb for a period of thirty-four years; from the time of the man&#x2019;s death until his tomb was abandoned when Jerusalem was destroyed. And upon abandoning the man&#x2019;s tomb the seven angels appeared to us to reveal the truth of the man&#x2019;s death, entreating us to aid them in their sacred purpose. Now knowing the cousin of this man, who was called the Baptist, and upon hearing the voices of the seven angels of the Pure G-d, the teacher of righteousness identified them as the forces of light named in the War Scroll of our order. We pledged our souls to them and agreed to watch over the way of the man&#x2019;s return. We pledged in full knowledge that the forces of darkness, who sought to wipe all memory of the man from the world, would one day destroy us as they had destroyed Jerusalem.</p><p>The cavern of solitude was located in the canyon above Qumran and hid from the world by an outcrop of rock at the entrance. There were narrow fissures in the stone allowing me to see down onto the commune and witness the slaughter of my order. All my brethren, including the teacher of righteousness, suffered greatly before giving up their souls to death; but all kept their vow to not reveal any knowledge of the man of signs and wonders, though this knowledge was cruelly demanded of them.</p><p>The cohort then raided our stores of food and wine. Becoming drunk they ransacked the scriptorium for plunder. Finding nothing to please them, they took up battering rams and demolished the commune to rubble. But this destruction did not sate them, and they were overcome with savagery. They pounded their chest armor with fists; their curses filled the canyon with wickedness. Some drew swords and hacked apart the bodies of the dead, others built great fires; then was my brethren&#x2019;s flesh roasted and eaten. This unholy feast lasted into the night until a stupor came over the soldiers and they lay on the ground to sleep. Black clouds concealed the moon and stars that night, and when the fires ended there was no light of any kind; as if all the world had gone into hiding from the evil befallen us. At dawn, and hearing no sound, I went to the entrance of the cavern. There was no sign of the fifth cohort but for the slaughter they had committed.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>I had been commanded by the teacher of righteousness to not leave the cavern for forty days. In obeying his command I did not bury my brethren according to Jewish law. In so doing I watched the remains of my order devoured by the beasts of the desert. Many of my brethren&#x2019;s bones were carried away, though some remained that I might not be devoured by the beast of loneliness. But I did not touch the bones or bury them; I only watched them turn to dust. This had been commanded of me so I would not be detected by any forces of darkness who might pass; nor those foul spirits who feed on human souls; nor their progeny who were possessed of the same hunger and roamed the world in the forms of men.</p><p>In the month of Elul my forty days of hiding had ended. To replenish the cavern&#x2019;s food stocks I grew grains and vegetables on a nearby plot of irrigated land. This plot was long used by my order and not seen from the desert lowlands or the surrounding mountains. One parsa from this place were colonies of bees that did not abandon their hives, and I tended them for honey. Near Jericho&#x2019;s ruins, abandoned groves of date palm and pomegranate and olive trees, once belonging to Egypt&#x2019;s queen, continued to bear fruit, and I harvested them.</p><p>I was commanded also to lay aside the white robes of the order and take the appearance of a madman. For there are things to be seen in this desert that will deliver a man into madness if regarded too long and without enlightenment, and such woeful men are common along the Salt Sea. I sealed my robes and sandals in an empty jar to protect them from corruption. I ceased to perform the water purification rituals of my order. In summer I wore only a loincloth and walked the desert in bare feet; in winter I wore coarse animal skins for warmth. My hair and beard became long and matted; my flesh darkened and leathered. In doing all these things I would not be regarded as a son of the light.</p><p>I walked the hills and mountains above Qumran to watch over the caves in which were hid the holy scrolls of the Jewish people. Also hid were the scrolls of our order, including the Book of Community Rule and the War Scroll. And in a remote cave, five parsa&#x2019;ot in distance from Qumran&#x2019;s ruins, were the things for the man of signs and wonders as entrusted to us by the seven angels of the Pure G-d. This place was named the cavern of secrets by the teacher of righteousness.</p><p>Through innumerable seasons I watched people travel across the Jordan Valley, wondering if one of them would reveal himself to me as the man foretold to us. There were merchant caravans from the east, Syrians and Phoenicians from the north, tribes of nomads from the south. Some of these travelers camped within sight of Qumran. They grazed their animals at the mouth of the Jordan River where it flows into the Salt Sea. Some travelers, chasing after their wandering flocks, climbed the trail to the ruins of our commune. Finding Roman coins or arrow points or other things of use, and not knowing the history of the place, most were satisfied and left. Those more curious of the place dared to approach the caves.</p><p>I hurried through the cliffs by unseen trails and jumped out before all invaders. I threw stones and called to Baal and proclaimed this ground as my divinely given kingdom. I chanted in tongues, rolled my eyes, and spittle formed on my lips. I became a creature of such dread that the invaders feared the curse of desert madness would claim them, too, and they retreated.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>I lost count of the days long ago.</p><p>I do not know the number of years I have lived since the destruction of Qumran. In this season of summer I became much weakened. It became difficult for me to walk the trails or gather food. Then did questions come to me. In the war between the forces of light and the darkness, as written in the War Scroll of our order, had the man of signs and wonders been vanquished? Was all hope of his return lost? If so, what had been the purpose of my terrible isolation? Why was I not sacrificed with the members of my order? But these questions were without answer and sorrow weighed heavily on my soul; the last soul belonging to a son of the light.</p><p>Then did a tempest come up from the land of the Edomites, and the sky became thick with dust and the sun yellowed as if diseased. I could not see the lowlands or the Salt Sea for the blowing sand. As night fell the winds increased tenfold; then came the wails of the world&#x2019;s unburied and forgotten dead. Included in their number were the members of my order who had sacrificed their souls to forever death. By these signs I knew forces of darkness were passing the ruins of Qumran in search of the cavern of secrets.</p><p>I grew fearful, with only the flame of an oil lamp for consolation. I cried out to the Pure G-d and begged Him to give me succor. But the tempest mocked me for my cries, and the ground shook and the outcrop of rock at the cavern&#x2019;s entrance fell away. A suffocating dust, foul with putrefaction, rushed in to extinguish the lamp and I was blinded. I heard the screams of the world&#x2019;s unburied and forgotten dead approach; I felt their tormented souls reach from the dust and claw at my flesh, wanting to drag me down to the woeful place where they were imprisoned by the forces of darkness. And they begged me to save them by revealing the way to the cavern of secrets. So torn between my oath and the pitiful souls about me that I was overcome with despair, I crawled to the entrance of the cavern to throw myself from the cliffs and so end my own torment. I reached the edge of the cliff, rose to my feet, and stepped toward the abyss. Then came the roar of a thousand wings, and the whirlwind so created held me in place, and I beheld a vision.</p><p>The tempest vanished and I saw the Pure G-d asleep in an immense void above the earth and nothing moved. He stirred and awoke and saw that He was alone in his place. He breathed and a fire was born into the void. By this light He reached down to the earth and gathered the world&#x2019;s unburied and forgotten dead. He anointed them with tongues of fire and cast them into the void where they became the stars and spheres of the heavens. Then a great comet rose from the east and it hovered over Qumran&#x2019;s ruins. And the comet burst into ten thousand stars, and they did form the constellation Kes�l. From them appeared the seven angels of the Pure G-d who had entreated us to aid them in their sacred purpose. They came down bearing a body bound in a linen shroud, and they laid it on the ground. Then the leader of the seven smiled upon me, as he had smiled upon us in the days after Jerusalem was destroyed, and he said:</p><p>&#x201c;They will see the dwelling place of the Pure G-d,</p><p>They will see the time of angels,</p><p>They will see the coming of the light.&#x201d;</p><p>And the angel drew his sword and cut open the shroud to reveal the face of the man of signs and wonders, and he was of the light. And the angel said:</p><p>&#x201c;By your words will he be raised from the dead,</p><p>So that the world will know the light.&#x201d;</p><p>The sun rose above Mount Nebo and I was returned to the world. I knew my years of isolation were not in vain. I knew the man foretold to us would return, but not in the time of men; he would return in the time of angels when the secrets of the heavens are so revealed. And thus, my own sacred purpose was made known to me. I must guide the way of the man&#x2019;s ret...</p></p><h2>Play Theory of Mass Communication</h2><p>Great book for research, study, or review!</p><p></p><h2>Understanding Wood Finishing</h2><p><p><strong>Take the mystery out of wood finishing!</strong> Inside you will find:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The latest technical updates</strong> on materials and techniques&#x2014;from spray guns to French polishing</li> <li><strong>Detailed instructions and explanations</strong> that take the mystery out of the science</li> <li><strong>Over 300 color photos</strong> that help you distinguish between products, make decisions, and solve problems</li> <li><strong>More than 40 must-have reference tables</strong> and troubleshooting guides</li> <li><strong>Chapters on everything wood finishing</strong>, including: <ul> <li>Preparing the wood</li> <li>Tools for applying finishes</li> <li>Staining wood</li> <li>Oil and wax finishes</li> <li>Filling the pores</li> <li>Film finishes, shellac, lacquer, varnish, two-part, and water-based finishes</li> <li>How to choose the best finish</li> <li>Advanced coloring techniques</li> <li>Finishing different types of wood</li> <li>Finish care &amp; repair</li> <li>Exterior finishes</li> <li>Removing finishes</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For more than 18 years, Bob Flexner has been inspiring woodworkers with his writings and teachings on wood finishing.

Gorbachev</h2><p>Presents a candid study of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, drawing on previously unavailable sources to describe his early life and his rise to political power</p><p>Of the many works on Gorbachev and his policies, Sheehy's perhaps best conveys her subject's ambition and self-assurance in a life of profound discontinuity. While Sheehy ( Passages; Character: America's Search for Leadership, LJ 8/88) lacks a clear sense of the institutions shaping Gorbachev, she has assembled a wealth of material from perceptive interviews with lifelong acquaintances and colleagues. Indeed, their candor confirms Sheehy's conclusion that Gorbachev's "most important legacy" lies in the "lifting of fear and the creation of a new political generation." Her appraisal of Raisa's importance in her husband's life seems beyond doubt. Nevertheless, the work suffers from certain flaws. Plausible detail becomes certainty; facile phrases often take the place of analysis; and Gorbachev's life before the 1985 elevation to General Secretary is disproportionately emphasized. Many readers will find Sheehy has done little to make Gorbachev less enigmatic. Nevertheless, the interview material is fascinating and valuable. Recommended for larger universities and public libraries. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 7/90.<br><i>- Zachary T. Irwin, Beh rend Coll., Penn State-Erie</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA-- A riveting book. Sheehy's narrative style is conversational and breezy, but the ease with which this book may be read should not mislead anyone as to its serious and rigorous scholarship. She hunts down the enigmatic character of Gorbachev as a sleuth would uncover an intriguing, challenging mystery. She fits bits of evidence together until, piece by piece, a mosaic begins to emerge of a dominant, confident, energetic, fascinating man who is doomed to failure. One of the book's values lies in the contemporary look at how the USSR really works, and how the people suffer, cope, and survive. Sheehy's work is better than any classroom course on the USSR because it is nontheoretical, reality-based, and grounded in the Soviet people themselves. Students will love it.<br><i>- Vicki Fox, R.

But in this brand-new edition, Shelley's haunting horror story is transformed with the addition of steampunk-inspired art. <p>With elaborate full-color illustrations throughout, this is a truly unique interpretation of <i>Frankenstein</i>. It's a fresh look at a classic story, spiked with gadgets, fashion, and steam-powered machinery inspired by the hottest trend in science-fiction.

He recently served as the sole director and producer of the short film <i>Escargot</i>.</p>Gr 9 Up-Steampunk...Frankenstein combines the third edition of Mary Shelley's book with new illustrations. The introduction does an excellent job of explaining the choice of manuscript-the third edition was the first to include a personal introduction by the author-as well as the reasoning behind the marriage of the classic sci-fi novel and the gothic/Victorian style of art. The personal introduction by Shelley provides the necessary context to set the stage for the highly atmospheric quality of this unique edition. The classic tale tells of Dr. Frankenstein's discovery of the essence of life and creation of an animated being that later becomes a rampaging monster. Traditionally known as the precursor to the modern science fiction genre, it was written with the flowery language and richly descriptive style typical of that time period. The dramatic nature of the story pairs well with the richly hued style of art found throughout. However, the serious nature of the plot is not always complemented by the bespectacled figures featured in the accompanying illustrations. For those uninitiated to the steampunk style, the characters could simply look like goofy individuals in goggles. While fans of steampunk will likely enjoy this offering, this title will not win any new converts to the genre. Readers who enjoy classic literature will love this story with or without illustrations, so this book is strictly an additional purchase.-Sunnie Sette, New Haven Public Library, CT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

It&#39;s a book that sets the foundation for the whole of Scripture and upon which all the other books of the Bible rest. Genesis is essential to understanding God our Creator, Judge, and Savior. Every vital Christian doctrine finds its roots in the Genesis record. In Why Genesis Matters, Dr. Jason Lisle points us to the very first book of the Bible to understand the foundation of Christian doctrines. Which doctrines are first introduced in Genesis? How do we really know if we&#39;re interpreting Genesis correctly? What about the debate over the age of the earth? And how does Genesis help us when we share the gospel with others? These and other questions are answered in this practical book about Genesis, Christian doctrine, and the gospel.</p><p></p><h2>Aloft</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling novel by the critically acclaimed author of <i>Native Speaker</i> and <i>A Gesture Life</i>.</b><br><br> At 59, Jerry Battle is coasting through life. His favorite pastime is flying his small plane high above Long Island. Aloft, he can escape from the troubles that plague his family, neighbors, and loved ones on the ground. But he can't stay in the air forever. Only months before his 60th birthday, a culmination of family crises finally pull Jerry down from his emotionally distant course.<br><br> Jerry learns that his family's stability is in jeopardy. His father, Hank, is growing increasingly unhappy in his assisted living facility. His son, Jack, has taken over the family landscaping business but is running it into bankruptcy. His daughter, Theresa, has become pregnant and has been diagnosed with cancer. His longtime girlfriend, Rita, who helped raise his children, has now moved in with another man. And Jerry still has unanswered questions that he must face regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of his late wife.<br><br> Since the day his wife died, Jerry has turned avoiding conflict into an art form-the perfect expression being his solitary flights from which he can look down on a world that appears serene and unscathed. From his comfortable distance, he can't see the messy details, let alone begin to confront them. But Jerry is learning that in avoiding conflict, he is also avoiding contact with the people he loves most.</p><p>Chang-Rae Lee, named by <i>The New Yorker</i> as one of its 20 writers for the 21st Century, has confirmed his place in that company with <i>Aloft</i>, a masterful treatment of a man coming to terms with his own disaffection. In two previous novels, <i>Native Speaker</i> and <i>A Gesture Life</i>, Lee, a Korean-American, writes of lives being not what they seem: in the first, the protagonist is an undercover agent; in the second, the two halves of Franklin Hata's life never quite come together. Both novels won numerous awards, including Best First Novel, the Hemingway PEN Award, the American Book Award and the Asian-American Literary Award, among others. In <i>Aloft</i>, Lee revisits alienation, a fractured family, mixed heritage and the quest for identity.<p> Jerry Battle, 59-year-old widower and father of two, retired from the family business--the unmistakably earthbound Battle Brothers Brick and Mortar--buys a small airplane because "From up here, a half mile above the Earth, everything looks perfect to me." All is not well below. Jerry knows it, saying</p><p> </p><blockquote>...the recurring fantasy of my life... is one of perfect continuous travel, this unending hop from one point to another, the pleasures found not in the singular marvels of any destination but in the constancy of serial arrivals and departures, and the comforting companion knowledge that you&#x2019;ll never quite get intimate enough for any trouble to start brewing.</blockquote><p> His view from aloft saves him from the gritty reality of the detritus of life--and from life itself.</p><p> This high-flyer must come to earth, however, when he finds that his daughter is newly pregnant, diagnosed with cancer, and refusing treatment; his son, who is running the company, has piled up enough debt that bankruptcy is imminent; and his father has gone missing from his assisted living facility.

Yet in the decade following the ratification of the Constitution, the republic's existence was contingent and fragile, challenged by domestic rebellions, foreign interference, and the always-present danger of collapse into mob rule.<br>Carol Berkin reveals that the nation survived almost entirely due to the actions of the Federalist leadership--George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and John Adams. Reacting to successive crises, they extended the power of the federal government and fended off foreign attempts to subvert American sovereignty. As Berkin argues, the result was a spike in nationalism, as ordinary citizens began to identify with their nation first, their home states second.<br>While the Revolution freed the states and the Constitution linked them as never before, this landmark work shows that it was the Federalists who transformed the states into an enduring nation.<br></p><p><b>Carol Berkin </b>is the Baruch Presidential Professor of History at the CUNY Graduate Center.

Berkin makes a reasonable case that the Founders' resolve left the U.S. a viable nation." <b><i>--Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>"In <i>A Sovereign People</i>, Carol Berkin has given us a powerful story about the birth of America-but one that most of us missed in school. After the Declaration and the Revolutionary War and the Constitutional Convention, what then? As Washington says to Hamilton in Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical, 'Winning was easy, young man. Governing's harder.' Just how much harder comes through in Berkin's compelling narrative, as she shows how the newborn republic survived a series of potentially fatal crises in the 1790s and toughened into a viable nation." <br><b>--James Basker, President, Gilder Lehrman Institute of America</b><br><br>"Carol Berkin's masterful new book guides readers through the turbulent first decade of government under the Constitution. The decisions of the nation's first congresses and presidential administrations ensured the nation's survival and set precedents for our enduring national values.

The new system of government, Berkin persuasively argues, was promptly tested by four crises. With meticulous research and vivid prose, Berkin deftly shows how the Federalist leadership not only weathered these emergencies but molded the fragile republic into a stable nation.

Her astute analysis of four foreign and domestic crises brings the critical decade of the 1790s to life, capturing the tensions, the hopes and the fears of the people charged with creating the basis for a new and as yet untried nation. A tour de force."<b>--Sheila Skemp, Clare Leslie Marquette Professor Emerita of History, University of Mississippi</b><br>"Carol Berkin has written a convincing reinterpretation of the four major crises of the 1790s.

At Cambridge, Lowry recklessly goaded suicidal fellow classmate Paul Fitte to kill himself, a fatal taunt that left Lowry with lifelong guilt. In this ruthlessly probing biography, British freelance journalist Bowker skillfully navigates the maze of Lowry's messy life marked by violent alcoholism, two unstable marriages and stints in jails and mental institutions as he drifted to and from London, Paris, New York and Mexico. Lowry's novel Under the Volcano (1947), a savagely honest portrait of his alcoholic suffering, is an existential exploration of alienation, exile and identity, but he never produced another masterpiece, claims Bowker, because his energies were diverted by accidents, illnesses, booze, private terrors and his second marriage, at once "idyllic and Strindbergian," to former silent-movie actress Margerie Bonner. She told a selected few friends that Lowry committed suicide. Though the circumstances surrounding the writer's death remain a mystery, Bowker makes a startling observation: Lowry, who was obsessed with dates, died on Paul Fitte's birthday.

The film should have been a box office smash, but even before cameras rolled, things began going wrong--and Clark recorded it all in this beguiling, fly-on-the-wall diary.</p><p>Forty years ago, Colin Clark, the son of art historian Kenneth Clark, accepted a job as a "gofer" on the set of Laurence Olivier's film The Prince and the Showgirl, which was to star Olivier and Marilyn Monroe. By day, Clark satisfied the every whim of director Olivier and other crew members; by night, he chronicled the day's events in his diary, compiling a vivid and witty introduction to the craft and business of filmmaking. Now he is publishing the diary virtually intact. It's a wickedly entertaining little book, a delicious backstage comedy of the clash of two worlds, as well as a candid time capsule of a heedless young Englishman's sexual progress, circa 1956. At center stage are the classically trained Olivier, leading a crew of expert British film professionals, and a sad and volatile Monroe, surrounded by manipulative and sycophantic hangers-on. Clark's thumbnail judgments of the principals are shrewd, sometimes harsh; playwright Arthur Miller, who married the actress just before the film began production, comes across as particularly unpleasant. Full of the sort of stories and observations film insiders tell only each other (Monroe upon Clark's first scrutiny: "She looked absolutely frightful.... Nasty complexion, a lot of facial hair, shapeless figure and, when the glasses came off, a very vague look in her eye"), this diary is a breezy, gossipy, often hilarious read. Photos. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Clark, son of historian Sir Kenneth Clark, spent his days just after college as third assistant director (read gofer) on the set of the 1957 British film The Prince and The Showgirl. What made this film unique, and the reason Clark decided to keep a daily journal, was the unlikely pairing of Marilyn Monroe and Sir Lawrence Olivier in the title roles. Monroe hoped this would give her a more serious image; Olivier hoped to boost his film career. But Monroe was insecure; treated badly by her new husband, Arthur Miller; and often late and on drugs. Olivier, the consummate professional, had no patience. Though the diary is amusing, it sheds little new light on the Monroe legend, and though it gives the reader a bird's-eye view of an interesting place and time, its narrow scope keeps it from being a necessary purchase.

CAT may perhaps represent a milestone in orgasmology, but, as the authors note, the technique takes practice, coordination is crucial, and men, who must learn not to thrust, sometimes have difficulty climaxing with CAT. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shadow Children Boxed Set: Among the Hidden, Among the Impostors, Among the Betrayed, and Among the Barons</h2><p>Imagine a world where families are allowed only two children.

Now, in <em>Lord of Emperors,</em> the internationally acclaimed author of <em>The Lions of Al-Rassan</em> continues his most powerful work.</p><p>In <em>Sailing to Sarantium,</em> the first volume in the Sarantine Mosaic, renowned mosaicist Crispin--beckoned by an imperial summons of the Emperor Valerius--made his way to the fabled city of Sarantium. A man who lives only for his craft, who cares little for ambition, less for money, and nothing for intrigue, Crispin now wants only to confront the challenges of his art high upon a dome that will become the emperor's magnificent sanctuary and legacy.</p><p>But Crispin's desire for solitude will not be fulfilled. Beneath him the city swirls with rumors of war and conspiracy, while otherworldly fires mysteriously flicker and disappear in the streets at night. Valerius is looking west to Crispin's homeland of Varena to assert his power--a plan that may have dire consequences for the family and friends Crispin left behind. But loyalty to his homeland comes at a high price, for Crispin's fate has become entwined with that of Valerius and his empress, as well as the youthful Queen Gisel, his own monarch who is an exile in Sarantium herself. And now another voyager arrives in Sarantium, a physician determined to earn his fortune amid the shifting currents of loyalty, intrigue, and violence.</p><p>Drawing from the twin springs of history and legend, <em>Lord of Emperors</em> is also a deeply moving exploration of art, power, and the ways in which people from all walks of life seek to leave an impressionthat endures long after thery're gone. It confirms Kay's place as one of the most esteemed masters of fantasy.</p></p><p>For whatever reason, Guy Gavriel Kay just insists on getting better and better. <i>Sailing to Sarantium</i> outshone the already excellent <i>Lions of Al-Rassan</i>, and now <i>Lord of Emperors</i>--the stunning second half of the Sarantine Mosaic--somehow surpasses even its predecessors. <p> <i>Emperors</i> picks up the story of the overwhelmed but still tenacious Crispin, now Imperial Mosaicist to Valerius II and thoroughly steeped in the machinations of Sarantium--not to mention being personally entangled in the lives of the emperor, the empress, and now his own queen, the exiled Gisel. <i>Lord of Emperors</i> also sends a new protagonist sailing into Sarantium, an unassuming country doctor who--like Caius--has found himself thrust into a position of great potential and peril, a victim of both circumstance and his own competence and moxie. The two struggle to stay afloat in Sarantium's swirling intrigues, as Valerius prepares for war in Crispin's homeland and unexplained, ghostly fires flicker around the city. </p><p> A touching, literate, and doggedly intelligent book, <i>Lord of Emperors</i> continues to prove Kay's mastery of historical fantasy (Sarantium being a well-researched analog to sixth-century Byzantium under Justinian and Theodora), as he gracefully spins a rich, convincing weave of legend and history. While other fantasy titles might have us imagine our lives as great heroes, Kay leaves a far more lasting impression by celebrating the heroics and passions of ordinary people who possess extraordinary character and spirit. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><p>GUY GAVRIEL KAY is acknowledged as one of the world&#x2019;s foremost fantasy authors. He is the author of eleven novels, and his works have been translated into twenty-five languages. Kay lives in Toronto with his family.

He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><p><b>1. 'CAN I HELP YOU?'</b></p> <p>The Secret Service holds much that is kept secret even from very senior officers in the organisation. Only M and his Chief of Staff know absolutely everything there is to know. The latter is responsible for keeping the Top Secret record known as 'The War Book' so that, in the event of the death of both of them, the whole story, apart from what is available to individual Sections and Stations, would be available to their successors.</p> <p>One thing that James Bond, for instance, didn't know was the machinery at Headquarters for dealing with the public, whether friendly or otherwise - drunks, lunatics, bona fide applications to join the Service, and enemy agents with plans for penetration or even assassination.</p> <p>On that cold, clear morning in November he was to see the careful cog-wheels in motion.</p> <p>The girl at the switchboard at the Ministry of Defence flicked the switch to 'Hold' and said to her neighbour, 'It's another nut who says he's James Bond. Even knows his code number. Says he wants to speak to M personally.'</p> <p>The senior girl shrugged. The switchboard had had quite a few such calls since, a year before, James Bond's death on a mission to Japan had been announced in the Press. There had even been one pestiferous woman who, at every full moon, passed on messages from Bond from Uranus where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting entry into heaven. She said, 'Put him through to Liaison, Pat.'</p> <p>The Liaison Section was the first cog in the machine, the first sieve. The operator got back on the line: 'Just a moment, sir. I'll put you on to an officer who may be able to help you.'</p> <p>James Bond, sitting on the edge of his bed, said, 'Thank you.'</p> <p>He had expected some delay before he could establish his identity. He had been warned to expect it by the charming 'Colonel Boris' who had been in charge of him for the past few months after he had finished his treatment in the luxurious Institute on the Nevsky Prospekt in Leningrad. A man's voice came on the line. 'Captain Walker speaking. Can I help you?'</p> <p>James Bond spoke slowly and clearly. 'This is Commander James Bond speaking. Number 007. Would you put me through to M, or his secretary, Miss Moneypenny. I want to make an appointment.'</p> <p>Captain Walker pressed two buttons on the side of his telephone. One of them switched on a tape recorder for the use of his department, the other alerted one of the duty officers in the Action Room of the Special Branch at Scotland Yard that he should listen to the conversation, trace the call, and at once put a tail on the caller. It was now up to Captain Walker, who was in fact an extremely bright ex-prisoner-of-war interrogator from Military Intelligence, to keep the subject talking for as near five minutes as possible. He said, 'I'm afraid I don't know either of these two people. Are you sure you've got the right number?'</p> <p>James Bond patiently repeated the Regent number which was the main outside line for the Secret Service. Together with so much else, he had forgotten it, but Colonel Boris had known it and had made him write it down among the small print on the front page of his forged British passport that said his name was Frank Westmacott, company director.</p> <p>'Yes,' said Captain Walker sympathetically. 'We seem to have got that part of it right. But I'm afraid I can't place these people you want to talk to. Who exactly are they? This Mr Em, for instance. I don't think we've got anyone of that name at the Ministry.'</p> <p>'Do you want me to spell it out? You realise this is an open line?'</p> <p>Captain Walker was rather impressed by the confidence in the speaker's voice. He pressed another button and, so that Bond would hear it, a telephone bell rang. He said, 'Hang on a moment, would you? There's someone on my other line.' Captain Walker got on to the head of his Section. ' Sorry, sir. I've got a chap on who says he's James Bond and wants to talk to M. I know it sounds crazy and I've gone through the usual motions with the Special Branch and so on, but would you mind listening for a minute? Thank you, sir.'</p> <p>Two rooms away a harassed man, who was the Chief Security Officer for the Secret Service, said 'Blast!' and pressed a switch. A microphone on his desk came to life. The Chief Security Officer sat very still. He badly needed a cigarette, but his room was now 'live' to Captain Walker and to the lunatic who called himself 'James Bond'. Captain Walker's voice came over at full strength. 'I'm sorry. Now then. This man Mr Em you want to talk to. I'm sure we needn't worry about security. Could you be more specific?'</p> <p>James Bond frowned. He didn't know that he had frowned and he wouldn't have been able to explain why he had done so. He said, and lowered his voice, again inexplicably, 'Admiral Sir Miles Messervy. He is head of a department in your Ministry. The number of his room used to be twelve on the eighth floor. He used to have a secretary called Miss Moneypenny. Good-looking girl. Brunette. Shall I give you the Chief of Staff's name? No? Well let's see, it's Wednesday. Shall I tell you what'll be the main dish on the menu in the canteen? It should be steak-and-kidney pudding.'</p> <p>The Chief Security Officer picked up the direct telephone to Captain Walker. Captain Walker said to James Bond,' Damn! There's the other telephone again. Shan't be a minute.' He picked up the green telephone. 'Yes, sir?' '</p> <p>I don't like that bit about the steak-and-kidney pudding. Pass him on to the Hard Man. No. Cancel that. Make it the Soft. There was always something odd about 007's death. No body. No solid evidence. And the people on that Japanese island always seemed to me to be playing it pretty close to the chest. The Stone Face act. It's just possible. Keep me informed, would you?'</p> <p>Captain Walker got back to James Bond. 'Sorry about that. It's being a busy day. Now then, this inquiry of yours. Afraid I can't help you myself. Not my part of the Ministry. The man you want is Major Townsend. He should be able to locate this man you want to see. Got a pencil? It's No. 44 Kensington Cloisters. Got that? Kensington double five double five. Give me ten minutes and I'll have a word with him and see if he can help. All right?'</p> <p>James Bond said dully, 'That's very kind of you.' He put down the telephone. He waited exactly ten minutes and picked up the receiver and asked for the number.</p> <p>James Bond was staying at the Ritz Hotel. Colonel Boris had told him to do so. Bond's file in the KGB Archive described him as a high-liver, so, on arrival in London, he must stick to the KGB image of the high life. Bond went down in the lift to the Arlington Street entrance. A man at the news stand got a good profile of him with a buttonhole Minox. When Bond went down the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire for a taxi, a canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked away busily from a Red Roses laundry van at the neighbouring goods entrance and, in due course, the same van followed Bond's taxi while a man inside the van reported briefly to the Action Room of the Special Branch.</p> <p>No. 44 Kensington Cloisters was a dull Victorian mansion in grimy red brick. It had been chosen for its purpose because it had once been the headquarters of the Empire League for Noise Abatement, and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this long-defunct organisation, the empty shell of which had been purchased by the Secret Service through the Commonwealth Relations Office. It also had a spacious old-fashioned basement, re-equipped as detention cells, and a rear exit into a quiet mews. The Red Roses laundry van watched the front door shut behind James Bond and then moved off at a sedate speed to its garage not far from Scotland Yard while the process of developing the canonflex film went on in its interior.</p> <p>'Appointment with Major Townsend,' said Bond.</p> <p>'Yes. He's expecting you, sir. Shall I take your raincoat?' The powerful-looking doorman put the coat on a coathanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks beside the door. As soon as Bond was safely doseted with Major Townsend, the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory on the first floor where its provenance would be established from an examination of the fabric. Pocket dust would be removed for more leisurely research. 'Would you follow me, sir?'</p> <p>It was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard with a tall, single window which concealed the Fluoroscope triggered automatically from beneath the ugly patterned carpet. The findings of its X-ray eye would be fed into the laboratory above the passage. The passage ended in two facing doors marked 'A' and 'B'. The doorman knocked on Room B and stood aside for Bond to enter.</p> <p>It was a pleasant, very light room, dose-carpeted in dove-grey Wilton. The military prints on the cream walls were expensively framed. A small, bright fire burned under an Adam mantelpiece which bore a number of silver trophies and two photographs in leather frames - one of a nice-looking woman and the other of three nice-looking children. There was a central table with a bowl of flowers and two comfort-able club chain on either side of the fire. No desk or filing cabinets, nothing official-looking. A tall man, as pleasant as the room, got up from the far chair, dropped The Times on the carpet beside it, and came forward with a welcoming smile. He held out a firm, dry hand.</p> <p>This was the Soft Man.</p> <p>'Come in. Come in. Take a pew. Cigarette? Not the ones I seem to remember you favour. Just the good old Senior Service.'</p> <p>Major Townsend had carefully prepared the loaded remark - a reference to Bond's liking for the Morland Specials with the three gold rings. He noted Bond's apparent lack of comprehension. Bond took a cigarette and accepted a light. They sat down facing one another. Major Townsend crossed his legs comfortably. Bond sat up straight Major Townsend said, 'Well now. How can I help you?'</p> <p>Across the corridor, in Room A, a cold Office-of-Works cube with no furnitu...</p></p><h2>The family Christmas tree book</h2><p>A family discusses the origin of the Christmas tree as it decorates its own.</p><p></p><h2>The Threat and the Glory: Reflections on Science and Scientists</h2><p>Discusses the philosophy of science and the process of scientific discovery, and looks at ethical issues such as genetic engineering, prolonging life through technology, and the role of the physician</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> The late <em>Sir Peter Medawar</em>, who won the Nobel Prize (with Sir Macfarlane Burnet) in 1960 for his work on tissue transplantation, was the author of numerous books on scientific issues.<br>The late Peter Medawar shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1960 for his discovery of acquired immunological tolerance, which cleared the way for organ transplants. He also was a graceful and philosophical writer. This is a collection of 23 of his essays, speeches, and book reviews, many never published in book form. The core is a set of six provocative BBC lectures on "The Future of Man," covering genetics, education, birth control, and other factors that influence our species. Equally stimulating are essays offering insights on such questions as why more male babies then female babies are born in wartime, why smaller families tend to have smarter children, and even why the 15th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica could well have omitted an illustration of a giraffe: "I stake my reputation that no one who knows what a giraffe looks like found out by referring to an encyclopedia."

Though history tends to cast the early years of America in a glow of camaraderie, there were, in fact, many conflicts among the Founding Fathers&#x2014;none more important than the one between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The chief disagreement between these former friends centered on the highest, most original public office created by the Constitutional Convention&#x2014;the presidency. They also argued violently about the nation's foreign policy, the role of merchants and farmers in a republic, and the durability of the union itself. At the root of all these disagreements were two sharply different visions for the nation's future.<br><br>Acclaimed historian Thomas Fleming examines how the differing temperaments and leadership styles of Washington and Jefferson shaped two opposing views of the presidency&#x2014;and the nation. The clash between these two gifted men, both of whom cared deeply about the United States of America, profoundly influenced the next two centuries of America's history and resonates in the present day.</p><p><b>Thomas Fleming</b> is a distinguished historian and the author of more than fifty books. A frequent guest on PBS, C-SPAN, and the History Channel, Fleming has contributed articles to <i>American Heritage</i>, <i>MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History</i>, and many other magazines. He lives in New York City.<br>Prolific historian Fleming delivers a vivid, opinionated history of this conflict.... Among historians, Jefferson's star has been falling for 50 years. Fleming's frank hostility puts him at the far end of the scale, but he makes a fascinating case that Jefferson's charisma which peaked early with the Declaration of Independence was accompanied by fanciful political beliefs that continue to exert a malign influence on the office of the presidency.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br><b><i>Library Journal</i>, 3/1/15</b><br> Lightly documented, this work is not a research volume, but its clean and snappy prose make for a readable synthesis.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Booklist</i>, starred review, 3/15</b><br> Fleming looks beyond the standard history of the founding and early years of the nation to detail the contrasts in the backgrounds and personalities of these men [Washington and Jefferson] A fascinating look at American history from the perspective of personal relationships and political ideals.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i>, 3/16/15</b><br> [An] impassioned defense of Washington's presidency, and more entertaining for its interest in the pettiness and foibles of our oft-lionized founders.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Bookviews blog, April 2015</b><br> Thomas Fleming is already regarded as one of our nation's preeminent historians and with good reason <i>[The Great Divide]</i> is a totally fascinating insight into two men [Washington and Jefferson] and their colleagues who brought about a new nation.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Midwest Book Review</i>, April 2015</b><br> An in-depth examination of the deep and severe political disagreements between two of America's most influential Founding Fathers A fascinating study of strong-willed genius A must-have' for college and public library American History shelves.&#x201d;<br><br><b>What Would the Founders Think?, 5/17/15</b><br> An absorbing book that will enlighten many and shock some.

Tom Fleming rightly focuses on Jefferson and Washington, for it was in the nexus of their competing visions of the nation's destiny that the United States truly took shape. In this superb book, Fleming compellingly captures the drama of this clash of titans, showing how its outcome made the difference between national ruin and prosperity." Edward G. Lengel, Director, Papers of George Washington and author of <i>General George Washington, A Military Life</i><br><br>"George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were both tall Virginians who made curcial contributions to winning American independence. But they were otherwise polar opposites, with wildly diverging visions of their fledgling nation's destiny. In <i>The Great Divide</i>, Thomas Fleming quarries a lifetime's study of America's turbulent Founding Era to recount a character-clash waged against the backdrop of chronic domestic discord and overshadowed by blood-soaked revolution in France. The author's robust prose leaves no doubt where his own sympathies lie, but all readers of history will relish his gripping exploration of a conflict between realism and idealism that still resonates today."

It is a potent symbol or icon that can fire the imagination and emotions of men and women anywhere, any time. It can be a small amulet, a ring, a flag, a statue, a monument, and even a whole city. Think of a wedding ring. Think of the Statue of Liberty or the collapsing Twin Towers of New York, or the toppling statue of Saddam Hussein. Think of the Wailing Wall. Think of Jerusalem. . .</p> <p><b>Talisman</b> is a roller-coaster intellectual journey through the back streets and rat runs of history to uncover the traces in architecture and monuments of a secret religion that has shaped the world. The story takes us from Heliopolis to Luxor, Alexandria, Toulouse, Florence, Rome, Paris, London, Washington DC, New York, and finally to the global pandemonium following September 11, 2001. It is a tale filled with romance and intrigue, heroism and faith, peopled by ancient Egyptian astronomer-priests, Christian Gnostics, Hermetic sages, learned Jews, Arab savants, Occitan counts, Cathar "perfects," Knights Templar, Renaissance magi, Rosicrucian "invisibles," Bavarian Illuminati, and Freemasons.</p> <p>Pivotal historical events and processes, not least the Renaissance, the birth of scientific rationalism, and the French and American Revolutions, are radically re-evaluated in the light of new investigative evidence presented for the first time in Talisman. Even the belief that the United States has a "global mission," so obvious today, may ultimately prove to be less the result of a short-term reaction to terrorism than the inevitable working out of a covert plan originally set in motion almost 2000 years ago. </p> <p>With its eye-catching amazing revelations, extensive documentation, and all-encompassing theories, <b>Talisman</b> will ensure that its readers will never look at the world in the same way.</p><b>Graham Hancock </b>is the author and co-author of a number of bestselling investigations of historical mysteries, including <b>The Sign and the Seal</b>, <b>The Message of the Sphinx</b>, <b>Heaven&#x2019;s Mirror</b>, <b>The Mars Mystery</b>, and <b>Underworld</b>.

Hence the spate of books on it -- at least five in the past fifteen years. Why should this be and can there be anything more to say? After all, the most important aspects of gardening are, first, to grow plants that you like and to grow them well. Next, to have a firm and cooperative structure to the garden in which they are to be grown. Then, to work out the seasons of display during which you want your plantings to be effective so they make intense use of the site and never become boring; this will involve organizing successions, so that one plant is there to take over from another, as needed. Then we must recognize the importance of structural plants so that we can compose a cohesive picture, and of foliage even more than of flowers, since foliage is longer on the scene and is generally bolder. </p><p> Plants that are grown close to one another need to be able to help each other, visually. For instance, one that creates a haze of small, variegated leaves needs either to have an interesting structure as a plant, by way of compensation -- this is obtained by the tiered habit of <i>Comus alternifolia</i> 'Argentea'; or to have neighbors or a backdrop with more somber, perhaps bolder and contrasting foliage, rather than other small-leaved, variegated plants, which, carried to extremes, will produce the chaotic dog's-dinner effect. Leaf textures are an important consideration, and whether their surfaces are matt and light absorbing or glossy and light reflecting. </p><p> Then, at last, we reach color, but as can now be seen, it is not an end in itself. Yet it is a side to gardening that gets many gardeners worried. Choice of colour is so wide that they deliberately straitjacket themselves by developing prejudices against certain colors ('I hate orange') or in favor of others ('really, I should like my garden to be nothing but blue'). There are so many necessary restrictions in our lives that it seems a shame to impose more of them. For a broad understanding of our subject, I think we should recognize that all colors are potentially good but that certain expressions of a color may be bad, like a muddy magenta or a mawkish salmon. This recognition gives us plenty of scope for picking and choosing. </p><p> Now to color juxtapositions and here we're getting near the bone. Most popular are color harmonies or, as has more recently become a vogue phrase, colour theming. Say we have a purple-flowered plant that we like; we think, what can I put next to that? Orange? Oh dear no; the Joneses would be terribly shocked at anything so blatant. Color-anxious gardeners are always looking over their shoulders in fear of disapproval. Mauve, then? Yeees, but I don't really like mauve. How about lavender or lilac (meaning the color rather than the flower)? Yes, that sounds nice. </p><p> So we trot around the garden to find a lilac- or lavender-colored flower that's out now and that will go with our tall, deep mauve <i>Verbena bonariensis</i>. And we find <i>Thalictrum delavayi</i>, a haze of tiny mauve flowers but pining on its own. So we put them together. Voil�! And the Joneses congratulate us on our good taste, so we carry it a bit further, aiming perhaps at a purple border in the manner of the one at Sissinghurst Castle. </p><p> There is absolutely nothing wrong with all that, apart from subservience to the acknowledged superiority of the Joneses' views on taste. You should always listen to criticism, however. It may have a point. And never hesitate to put your critic on the spot by asking why? or why not? We may get fed up with children who are forever asking why, but it is really excellent and essential that they should be curious and enquiring. So, weigh up what the Joneses have to say and then decide for yourself </p><p> I often practice colour harmonies myself. But just consider what you may be missing if you stick only in that groove. Think, for instance, of the apricot-orange-flowered, dark-leaved small decorative dahlia, 'David Howard' with your <i>V bonariensis</i>. There you will have a strong contrast not only in color but also in form, the bold and solid as against the light, see-through verbena. </p><p> That could increase your pulse rate by a beat or two and I do believe that excitement is an essential element in the most successful gardening. To put similar flower and foliage colors together is easy and it is always safe. Nothing is going to jar. To contrast them is more difficult. The field is wide open. Contrast them with what? Contrast is everywhere and could lead to chaos; where do I start? </p><p> Experiment is another of gardening's excitements. Try it out and see. Discuss the results with an open-minded friend and decide how far your experiment has been successful and in what manner it could be improved. Go on from there, always using plants that you really do like. Something will result, you may be sure, and it will be your own baby. </p><p> Violent contrasts will sometimes work against all the odds, depending on the light and the time of day, on the time of year and on our own mood. As we emerge from the drabness of winter, we yearn for colour and almost anything goes so long as we can sate ourselves with it. You may, in February, have a huge bush of <i>Daphne mezereum</i>, wreathed along all its branches with mauve-pink blossom; and underneath, a carpet of brilliant orange <i>Crocus x luteus</i>, open to the warmth of the sun. How could you resist being gladdened? The two colors may be shouting at each other, but they are shouting for joy. </p><p> You will sometimes (especially in Scotland in summer) see a small front garden that is literally packed with every color under the sun, except, most likely, for grey (plenty of grey skies without that). It is wholly undigested and yet it is exuberant; it is full of joy, and that's a feeling that immediately communicates. 'What fun they've had!' you exclaim, even though you cannot approve the result. Probably the ingredients are all usable by yourself but, for one thing, you need larger patches as well as dots. Then you need quieter plants to set of the bright. But out-and-out disapproval of that psychedelic garden, a closing of the eyes while turning your head aside and whispering 'oh dear!', is merely to expose your priggishness and how you have missed out on the gutsy side of gardening. </p><p> Given the right circumstances, I believe that every color can be successfully used with any other and that is the message I hope to convey. It is not an approach that has so far been attempted, although Andrew Lawson's <i>The Gardener's Book of Colour</i> comes implicitly very near to it. There is something called the Color Wheel that I have never understood and that I shall not therefore attempt to explore or explain. It is somehow intended to demonstrate which colors may successfully be put together and which may not, but the outcome makes no sense to me, so I shall go my own way without. </p><p> Rules, it has been said, are made to be broken. If there are rules, for instance in harmony when learning to write your own music, it is probably a good thing to know and understand them, but not to be content to leave the matter there. Bach knew all the rules but broke them whenever he needed to, and that is what makes his music so constantly unexpected and enthralling, even two and a half centuries later. Gertrude Jekyll, in our own field, is always being quoted and supposedly imitated -- I shall quote her in due course to serve my own ends, for she was not hidebound by rules, which was what made her a supreme artist. </p><p> Not everyone has the gift of true originality but we can at least free ourselves of the unnecessary shackles imposed by convention. Go for it, would be my motto.</p></p><h2>Doll&#39;s Eyes</h2><p>Eve Tilden Klein, a scion of an upstanding Connecticut family, finds that the clairvoyance she has inherited from her mother is more a curse than a blessing</p><p>Wood wrote three occult novels in the 80's (Amy Girl, 1987, etc.), but her current publisher is promoting her as the author of Twins (1977)--a telling comment on a sagging career that may lift a bit with this vivid if formulaic mix of occult and serial-killer chills. This time, Wood's usual Lady Luckless is poor little rich girl Eve Klein, whose millions can't buy her relief from her other inheritance: the clairvoyant powers that have recently frightened off her husband, Sam. Hoping to confront him, Eve drives from her Connecticut estate to Sam's new house in Raven Lake, New York, where she's instantly felled by a vision of a woman mutilated and dying--the handiwork of local sociopath Adam Fuller, M.D., whose eyes (``empty...dead...glassy. Like a doll's eyes'') give away his utter inability to feel for others, the product of a buried childhood trauma: Fuller kills in the barren hope of feeling pity for his victims. Eve's call to the cops snares homicide legend Dave Latovsky, who takes her to see psychiatrist Terrence Bunner, who happens to have Fuller as a patient. When, at a party, Bunner lets on to Fuller that Eve--whom he won't identify--saw the killer in her vision, the mad M.D. tracks a gory path to the psychic, torturing and shooting Bunner, then a local newsman and his wife, to get Eve's name and address. Meanwhile, at Bunner's funeral, Latovsky notes Fuller's Ken-doll eyes and fingers him for the killer but can't nab him before Fuller snatches Eve, hauling her to his childhood home. There, Eve flashes on the child abuse that turned Fuller into a maniac.... A lurid, loose-jointed tale whose frantic action and emotionalism nearly obscure the familiarity (Koontz, King, etc.) of Wood's themes. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This latest from the author of Twins is a nerve-snapping, stomach-churning thriller. Wealthy Eve Klein has the unenviable ability to see the future when she touches people or even something associated with them. Although her unusual gift occasionally comes in handy, it has also driven away her husband, who doesn't want to live in a psychic fishbowl. Hoping for a reconciliation, she follows him to a lakeside bungalow in the Adirondacks where a small boy was tortured decades earlier. Now grown, the one-time victim tracks down women, mutilating and killing them. At first, all Eve can see of him is light brown hair and tassled loafers near a puddle of blood, but as a local cop insists that she use her power, the killer's dead, brown eyes begin to haunt her visions, and it becomes clear he's hunting for her, too. Despite a spate of foolish set-ups that a child of six would know enough to avoid, Wood's page-turner nurtures a creeping dread that blooms into fully realized fears. Toward the end, Eve becomes a horrific Scheherazade, spilling dark, pain-filled secrets the killer's psyche has locked away for good reason.

Was it an accident, or something more sinister?&nbsp; It&#x2019;s up to Officer Gunnhildur, a sardonic female cop, to find out. Her investigation uncovers a web of corruption connected to Iceland&#x2019;s business and banking communities. Meanwhile, a rookie crime journalist latches onto her, looking for a scoop, and an anonymous blogger is stirring up trouble. The complications increase, as do the stakes, when a second murder is committed. <i>Frozen Assets</i> is a piercing look at the endemic corruption that led to the global financial crisis that bankrupted Iceland&#x2019;s major banks and sent the country into an economic tailspin from which it has yet to recover.</p><p><strong>A Note to Readers from Quentin Bates</strong> <p>Much of what became <em>Frozen Assets </em>took shape during Iceland's financial boom. Reykjav�k prospered and the country's bankers were hailed as financial wonders who appeared to have dug up a whole cache of Philosopher's Stones.</p> <p>Grumpy cynics had wondered when the bubble would burst, what would happen when all those private jets, limousines, and other status symbols had to be paid for. But the problem didn't lie solely with Iceland's nouveau riche maxing out credit cards on expensive toys. With banks frantically pushing bizarre dollar-euro-yen-franc loans at them, ordinary working families stockpiled luxury goods at a brisk clip.</p> <p>I spent much of 2008 in Iceland. In January everything was normal, if you consider a super-heated economy and sky-high prices normal. By springtime things were less comfortable. The exchange rate had started to slide for the first time in years and although nothing was said out loud, it was common knowledge that the banks' coffers were bare. Business was starting to slow, despite the forest of cranes dotting the skyline. There was a nagging uncertainty that maybe the economic miracle wasn't quite as copper-bottomed as people had been told.</p> <p>By summer, fear had permeated the society. Government and trade declared business as usual, but my friends and relatives all told me the same thing; behind the window-dressing, things were looking grim. Every working Joe knew something was brewing, without knowing what it was or when it would happen. Few people seriously believed the government was telling the whole truth.</p> <p>For a few months in the summer I stayed away, working on <em>Frozen Assets</em>. My rotund heroine, Gunna, had already jumped onto the page with a frown on her face and taken on a life of her own.</p> <p>Back in Iceland for an extended visit in October, I arrived on the day that the first of Iceland's hyper-inflated banks admitted that they'd been doing the equivalent of paying their Visa bills with Mastercard, and the government stepped in to help them out.</p> <p>An old friend greeted me with the words, "Congratulate me on my bank."</p> <p>"Why's that?"</p> <p>"Haven&#x2019;t you heard? Glitnir's been nationalized. It belongs to the taxpayer now--that's me."</p> <p>People were stunned, not so much by the fact that the bank had failed, but at the sheer depth of the corruption, greed, and incompetence behind that failure. Somehow Icelanders have always been tacitly resigned to the corruption of those in power, but this was taking things to a new high. As a writer, I couldn't help but feel a guilty thrill. It was fantastic material. I knew I had to rewrite <em>Frozen Assets</em> so that the last chapters would coincide with the dramatic events of 2008.</p> <p>Re-drafting <em>Frozen Assets</em> in the winter of 2008-09, I couldn't fathom the scale of what had happened, and even today, two years after the crash, new revelations are still coming to light.</p> <p>Hopefully <em>Frozen Assets </em>captures the desperate atmosphere in Iceland as its economy skidded toward the rocks. Without question, the fallout in the aftermath of the crash will reverberate through the rest of the series, just as it will for the residents of Iceland for many years to come.</p>Quentin Bates lived in Iceland for ten years, during which time he got married, produced a family, and generally went native. He moved back to the UK with his family in 1990 and became a full-time journalist at a commercial fishing magazine. He and his wife frequently return to Iceland, where they have many friends, including several in the Reykjavik police.</p><h2>The Scarlet Letters</h2><p><p>Ellery had a simple case. A few days of discreet snooping, some choice advice, and the inimitable sleuth would blithely restore domestic harmony to the millionaire couple Dirk and Martha Lawrence.

Unless Ellery did some super-fast sleuthing, he d have nothing to show but a very scarlet face. The case will drag him all over New York as he hunts for the truth.</p></p><p>Ellery Queen was a pen name created and shared by two cousins, Frederic Dannay (1905 1982) and Manfred B. Lee (1905 1971), as well as the name of their most famous detective. Born in Brooklyn, they spent forty-two years writing, editing, and anthologizing under the name, gaining a reputation as the foremost American authors of the Golden Age fair play mystery.Although eventually famous on television and radio, Queen s first appearance came in 1928, when the cousins won a mystery-writing contest with the book that would eventually be published as "The Roman Hat Mystery". Their character was an amateur detective who uses his spare time to assist his police inspector uncle in solving baffling crimes. Besides writing the Queen novels, Dannay and Lee cofounded "Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine", one of the most influential crime publications of all time. Although Dannay outlived his cousin by nine years, he retired Queen upon Lee s death. <br></p><h2>Promise and Power: The Life and Times of Robert McNamara</h2><p>The first comprehensive biography of Robert S.

Tour.</p><p>The former secretary of Defense and president of the World Bank here breaks a long silence on Vietnam and other matters in the more than 20 interviews that form the basis for freelance journalist Shapley's majestic biography. McNamara explains for the first time why he urged U.S. entry into Vietnam, offers his analysis of mistakes the government made and reveals why he urged American soldiers to fight on after he had decided the war was unwinnable. This major work doesn't confine itself to McNamara as war manager, however; Shapley also explores in impressive depth how McNamara accomplished the makeover of three massive institutions--the postwar Ford Motor Co., the Pentagon (where he reformed the defense budget and policy in positive, enduring ways) and the World Bank, where he helped spread the Green Revolution to small farmers and poor people in the Third World. Shapley goes far in unraveling the complexities of this enigmatic man--his deviousness and ruthless will, his violent emotions, his managerial brilliance and his noble goals. She is not always gentle with her prickly subject, about whom she ultimately delivers this startling verdict: "He is a pivotal figure in the weakening and decline of America, despite the many virtues of the American Century he embodies."

This first comprehensive biography of McNamara chronicles his youth and education before focusing on his varied career. Shapley taps a profusion of secondary and primary sources, including her own interviews with McNamara, to track the "whiz kid" from his early days teaching statistical control to Army Air Force officers in World War II through his climb to the presidency of Ford Motor Company, his pivotal role as secretary of defense in shaping America's Vietnam policy, to his impact on development as president of the World Bank. Throughout, Shapley highlights McNamara's commitment to statistical analysis and how his penchant for control affected the institutions and people he touched.

Lakers and its repercussions, especially for two players--Rudy Tomjanovich and Kermit Washington--in terms of such issues as race, violence in sports, and conspiracy. 175,000 first printing.</p><p>In 1977, Rudy Tomjanovich and Kermit Washington became entwined in a single punch that would change not only their lives, but how professional basketball is played today. Because the punch dislodged Tomjanovich's skull and nearly destroyed both men's careers, the scuffle never settled as a dusty bit of NBA trivia. Instead, it nearly superseded both men's notable achievements. The history of that punch (it could not, by any standards, be considered a fight) and the fate of the two men are the subjects of John Feinstein's <i>The Punch</i>.<p> In the early days of the NBA, teams had their stars and their "enforcers." Enforcers such as Washington protected star players on the court with their willingness to mix it up. With concise prose, Feinstein reports on this era, following strings of trades, drafts, and personal relationships to their nexus. Those who do not think about basketball on a statistical level may occasionally find themselves lost, but Feinstein, ever conscious of his subject, ties the tangents neatly to the core of the scuffle that led to the infamous punch.</p><p> Thorough and thoughtful, Feinstein does not make any excuses, nor does he vilify. He simply traces the web of both men's lives back to their adolescent years when it was not about the NBA, nor the punch, but about the game. Anyone who has ever wondered about these two men, or the history of the NBA, will want to read this book. <i>--Karin Rosman</i></p>John Feinstein is the bestselling author of &#34;The Last Amateurs,&#34; &#34;The Majors,&#34; &#34;A Good Walk Spoiled,&#34; &#34;A Civil War,&#34; &#34;A Season on the Brink,&#34; &#34;Play Ball,&#34; &#34;Hard Courts,&#34; and two novels.

It has been restored by human beings, page by page, so that you may enjoy it in a form as close to the original as possible. This book was created using print-on-demand technology. Thank you for supporting classic literature.</p><p>GEORGE MACDONALD (1824-1905), forerunner of the Inklings--Scottish minister, poet, novelist, and imaginative seer--was one of the most beloved Victorian authors throughout Great Britain and the U.S. in the 19th century. He wrote some 50 volumes of novels, poetry, short stories, fantasy, sermons, and essays. His influential body of work placed him alongside his eras great men of letters and his following was vast. Two decades after his death, his books were pivotal in leading C.S. Lewis to Christianity. He thus became the foundational member of Wheaton&#39;s Wade Center Seven. After his death, most of MacDonald&#39;s books eventually went out of print as his name drifted from memory. However, he continued to be revered by an impressive gallery of well-known figures, including G.K. Chesterton (who referred to him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century ), W.H. Auden (calling MacDonald one of the most remarkable writers of the 19th century), and Oswald Chambers ( ... how I love that man! ). In spite of such a following, however, MacDonald&#39;s reputation gradually declined throughout the 20th century. MacDonald&#39;s most notable champion of the last century was C.S. Lewis, whose journey from atheism to Christianity was sparked by George MacDonald&#39;s prophetic view of God. Lewis persistently acknowledged his debt to MacDonald, whom he called his master. Lewis wrote: &#34;I dare not say that he is never in error; but ... I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer ... to the Spirit of Christ Himself.... I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master, indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.&#34; Both in his autobiography and throughout his writing career, Lewis emphasized that George MacDonald was the most significant impetus in his own spiritual pilgrimage. MacDonald&#39;s writings can thus be seen as the spiritual soil out of which the faith of C.S. Lewis emerged. MacDonald&#39;s novels, fantasies, and fairy tales provide the imaginative foundation for Lewis&#39;s later writings, including the Chronicles of Narnia. In spite of his own popularity, however, the spiritual roots of Lewis&#39; s faith remain largely unknown. Lewis&#39;s words of 65 years ago are still true today. It has not seemed to me that those who have received my books kindly take ... sufficient notice of the affiliation [with George MacDonald]. Notwithstanding Lewis&#39; s frequent emphasis on the Scotsman&#39;s influence in his own life, MacDonald&#39;s name in the late 20th century drifted into obscurity and his books became unavailable. A resurgence of interest in the forgotten Victorian began to mount in the 1970s and 1980s, given initial impetus by Wheaton&#39;s Wade Center and the work of two Wheaton professors, Dr. Clyde Kilby, founder of the Center, and Dr. Rolland Hein, who released several editions of MacDonald&#39;s sermon extracts. MacDonald&#39;s name then exploded into public view in the years following, largely from the efforts of MacDonald redactor and biographer Michael Phillips. Building upon the efforts of Kilby, Hein, and others, and inspired by them, Phillips&#39;s work resulted in a new generation of readers discovering anew the treasures in MacDonald&#39;s stories, and led to a renewed publication of MacDonald&#39;s books on an unprecedented scale not seen since his own lifetime. Now more than ever, thousands the world over are discovering why Madeleine L. Engle called George MacDonald the grandfather of all of us who struggle to come to terms with truth through imagination.</p><h2>God&#39;s Big Picture</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

I recommend <b>The Art of Everyday Ecstasy</b> to anyone who wants to realize their ecstatic potential for living a life in which the spirit and everyday experience are intricately interwoven."<br>--Deepak Chopra, author of <b>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success</b> and <b>Ageless Body, Timeless Mind</b></p><p>"With all the wisdom, humor, warm stories, and pleasure-filled exercises packed into one book, <b>The Art of Everyday Ecstasy</b> is a real bargain."<br>--Stella Resnick, Ph.D., author of <b>The Pleasure Zone: Why We Resist Good Feelings</b> and <b>How to Let Go and Be Happy</b></p><p>"Margot Anand's inspirational book is a celebration of life that shows how to nurture creativity, healing, passion, and love within yourself and in your relationships."<br>--John Gray, author of <b>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</b></p><p>"Margot Anand guides us with clarity to where the music of the heart, body, and spirit sing in vibrant harmony."<br>--Don Campbell, author of <b>The Mozart Effect</b></p><b>Seven Tantric Keys of Awakening</b><br><br>The practices and rituals you will find here are doorways that reveal the inherent beauty and meaning of our ordinary moments.<br><br>Say yes to life in all its erotic passion.<br>Go with the flow of the life force within and all around you.<br>Trust yourself, and allow your personal power to manifest in life.<br>Open your heart in loving compassion to the self and others.<br>Authentically express your creativity and your truth.<br>Look within to achieve clarity and insight in your life.<br>Surrender to your Source and know gratitude, spiritual peace, and a new capacity to live at your maximum potential in every moment.<br><br>These seven Tantric keys can open us up to our essential selves and unleash in us that abundant, joyous energy--EveryDay Ecstasy--that allows us to be all that we can be as human beings with our partners and our children and in our work, our community, and the world. In the process, we discover the meaning of <i>elegance,</i> the art of achieving maximum results with minimum effort. Elegant people are in love with life. And their love calls them to make contributions beyond the call of mere duty, to participate fully, to share their joys, pains, gifts, and truths with others. And, by their example, they remind us that beyond our apparent differences, we are connected in Spirit, We are One.<br><br>My own spiritual journey, which led me to the path of EveryDay Ecstasy, began in Paris, when I was eighteen years old. I was wildly in love with my boyfriend; and the first time we made love, at the peak of orgasm, my consciousness expanded until, suddenly, unexpectedly, nothing was left but the absolute certainty that I was utterly and totally free and that this absolute freedom was, for me, the secret of life. This realization set the course of my life.<br><br>This may seem like an unusual beginning to many people. Yet most of us have enjoyed one unforgettable peak moment that leaves us with a yearning for that sense of ecstasy, wholeness, or exquisite peace. Unfortunately, our culture does not teach us the value of such experiences or the skills to cultivate them. But after this first ecstatic moment, I knew I wanted to discover how to integrate spirituality with sexuality in my daily life.<br><br>My studies and degrees in psychology and philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris did not bring any answers to my quest. Later, my practice as a therapist failed to satisfy my hunger for experiential wisdom. I turned to the study of bodywork therapies and self-development groups: bioenergetics, encounter groups, rolfing, Gestalt, Arica, integral yoga. And still I found no direct answers that explained the connection between sexuality and spirituality. I set out on a journey to explore the traditions of sacred sexuality around the world. I soon was introduced to the ancient Eastern science of Tantra; like yoga, Zen, and Sufism, Tantra is a spiritual path to enlightenment. But unlike most mystical paths, Tantra includes sexuality as a doorway to ecstasy and enlightenment. The essence of the Tantric teachings can be summarized as this: Choose with awareness what gives you joy, and it will lead you to Spirit. A particularly attractive approach, I thought, for us Westerners so deeply influenced by the puritanical Judeo-Christian tradition, which conceives of pleasure not as a door to heaven but rather as a shortcut to hell!<br><br>Although this book is not about sexuality, as my other books have been, the Tantric perspective has greatly influenced my work.<br><b>What Is Tantra?</b><br><br>Many people today mistakenly believe that Tantra is a spiritual bastardization of sexual therapy, an excuse to indulge in sensual games, an addiction to hours of sexual orgasms. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The Tantric path teaches us to embrace and unify the ordinary, the erotic, and the sacred dimensions of life, which all have their roots in Spirit.<br><br>The beauty and wisdom of Tantra is that it embraces sexuality as a doorway to the "ecstatic mind of great bliss."&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly, at the peak of orgasm, we pierce through the illusion of fragmentation and separation, and glimpse the unity and interconnectedness of all beings. And through the other--our partner--we fall in love with life.<br><br>Because sex holds this great potential for opening our being to the experience of ecstasy, Tantra has for millennia taught the cultivation of sexual love as an art, as a skillful spiritual practice. Then, as now, Tantra challenges the belief promoted by most spiritual and religious paths that we must suppress or transcend our sexuality to practice meditation or awaken our Spirit. Tantra arose in rebellion against these ascetical and life-negating creeds. It acknowledges that sex is at the root of life and that to make human sexuality and erotic union a form of worship and meditation is to practice reverence for life, leading us directly through the pleasure of the senses to spiritual liberation.<br><br>Tantra teaches that we master desires not by avoiding them but by immersing ourself in them. Once known and experienced deeply, they can be transcended. In fact, Tantra teaches that <i>nothing</i> is to be excluded from our understanding of reality. We need not suffer by sacrificing pleasures. We can cultivate them as opportunities for awakening. Tantra teaches us to embrace every moment in our totality, to respond bodily, feel from the heart, perceive with clarity, and be fully present to others and to life. In this book, we will explore ways to bring such energy, passion, and awareness to all our seemingly ordinary, and extraordinary, moments and to make our everyday life a journey of awakening.<br><br><i>Tantra</i> is a Sanskrit word derived from the root <i>tan,</i> "to expand."&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of my study and practice of the Tantric arts, I developed this definition: Tantra is the art of weaving the often contradictory aspects of our self or personality into a unified whole, for the purpose of expanding our consciousness. Scholar Ajit Mookerjee defines Tantra as "knowledge of a systematic, scientific, and experimental method which offers the possibility of expanding man's consciousness and faculties, a process through which the individual's inherent spiritual powers can be realized."<br><b>Create an Ecstatic Life</b><br><br>What if you began each day from a state of creative awareness, with a clear vision of what you want and how it can be achieved?&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you want to create a perfect dinner party for good friends, you begin with a vision of a warm gathering filled with intimate friendship, laughter, and good food. You begin, first imaginatively, then actually, to feel and create the atmosphere--you choose a menu, the lighting, the dishes you will use, the music or games you will play. You feel the enjoyment of the evening itself as you prepare for it and anticipate it throughout the day. Below is a ritual for starting your day with clarity, by opening all your centers.<br><br><b>A Ritual for Beginning the Day</b><br><br>Purpose<br><br>To remind yourself that each day represents a brand new opportunity to taste the sacredness of life; a chance to be nurtured by the mystery; a chance to relate lovingly, happily, and even with laughter to everyone around you.<br><br>Preparation<br><br>Have on hand a candle, incense, and matches.<br>Prepare a good sound system with slow, meditative music. (Be sure to pick music that will not interfere with your thoughts and that will not run out before the ritual is completed.)<br>Sit on a comfortable pillow.<br>Wake up fifteen minutes earlier to allow yourself the time to perform this ritual without feeling rushed.<br><br>Practice<br><br>As you wake up, open your eyes slowly, and close them. Then open them again, this time with awareness. Take a few slow, deep breaths and remind yourself that you wanted to get up early this morning to perform this ritual.<br>Get up, put on a robe (make sure you're warm and comfortable), and stretch slowly or shake your body loose from the night's sleep.<br>Light a candle and stick of incense to begin creating your sacred space.<br>Play your music.<br>Sit on your meditation pillow, in a comfortable position. If you are doing this ritual with a partner, sit opposite each other, holding hands.<br>Relax for a few moments, eyes closed, watching the movement of your breath. When you feel calm and quiet, go on to the next step.<br>Begin to focus gently and effortlessly on the day ahead, breathing slowly and deeply. Go through the day, envisioning each moment. See if one difficult challenge presents itself (for instance, you have too much to do today and not enough time to do it, or your child is home sick from school). Look at the thoughts as you would look at a passing landscape through a car window. Let the thoughts come and go.<br>Pay attention to your body. How does your body react to these thoughts?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel any tight spots?&nbsp;&nbsp;A constriction in your chest, stomach cramps, heart palpitations, a simple tensing of the muscles of your jaw and neck?&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom in on the part of your day's vision that is causing your body pain. This is what you will transform in the ritual. (If you find more than one painful area, take them one at a time. Don't try to do too much at once.)<br>Keep breathing calmly and deeply. Create a mental picture of the difficult moment that you're dreading in your day to come. (We'll use the example of a stressful project at work, one you have to work on with difficult people.) Now release the image, let it travel through your <i>chakras,</i> allowing the energy of each <i>chakra</i> to transform it.<br><br><i>The Root of Creation</i><br><br>Let your awareness dwell in the first <i>chakra,</i> in your genitals. Relax your genital muscles into the earth and allow them to feel vibrant, ready, grounded. Here is where you will generate the vision.<br>See the difficult situation existing inside your first <i>chakra,</i> let it resonate, and begin the transformation.<br>Say (to yourself or out loud), "There is enough time...</p><h2>Machine Embroidered Flowers, Woodlands and Landscapes: The Art of Alison Holt</h2><p>Drawing on material previously published as The Beginner&#x2019;s Guide to Machine Embroidered Flowers&#x2019;, The Beginner&#x2019;s Guide to Machine Embroidered Landscapes&#x2019; and Machine Embroidered Woodlands&#x2019;, this book provides a showcase of Alison Holt&#x2019;s exquisite machine embroideries.

Irshai examines these issues to probe gender-based values that underlie the interpretations and determinations reached by modern practitioners of halakhah. Her primary goal is to tell, through common halakhic tools, a different halakhic story, one that takes account of the female narrative and its missing perspective.</p><p>RONIT IRSHAI is an assistant professor in the gender studies program at Bar Ilan University and a lecturer in the Faculty of Law of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She is also a research fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem.&#x201c;This book is a first class pioneering effort in what may eventually become a critical area of research for students of Jewish law&#x2014;uncovering the extent to which unstated gender assumptions have informed halakhic process over the generations. In its focus upon issues related to the realm of reproduction, Irshai&#x2019;s study is of particular interest to women. However, in her application of feminist legal theory to a masterly grasp and analysis of the relevant halakhic sources, this study also converges with a broader need currently felt by several Anglo-American theoreticians to articulate a post-positivist vision of law.&#x201d; (Tamar Ross, Bar-Ilan University)<br><br>&#x201c;Ronit Irshai has written an impressively learned and well documented book detailing Jewish laws related to fertility and critiquing the application of these laws and their impact on women. Irshai&#x2019;s feminist critique is thoughtful, moderate, and deserving of discussion. It urges us to consider a different story than the one legal decisors tell, and that is the story women themselves would tell about living out these laws.&#x201d; (Rachel Adler, Hebrew Union College)</p><h2>Robocop</h2><p>Murphy, a tough cop nearly killed by vicious Detroit street gangs, is transformed into Robocop, a part-man, part-machine, invincible crime-fighting weapon designed to stop the street crime plaguing the city</p><p></p><h2>Essential Fantastic Four, Vol. 3 (Marvel Essentials)</h2><p>Presents the adventures of the Fantastic Four, a group of friends who were exposed to mysterious cosmic rays, which caused them to have phenomenal powers.</p><p>Jack Kirby (1917-1994)isone of the unqualified giants in American comic book history.His most famous co-creation, Captain America, is in a major motion picture film franchise from Marvel Studios.</p><h2>City on a Grid: How New York Became New York</h2><p>You either love it or hate it, but nothing says New York like the street grid of Manhattan. Created in 1811 by a three-man commission featuring headstrong Founding Father Gouverneur Morris, the plan called for a dozen parallel avenues crossing at right angles with many dozens of parallel streets in an unbroken grid. Hills and valleys, streams and ponds, forests and swamps were invisible to the grid; so too were country villages, roads, farms, and estates and generations of property lines. All would disappear as the crosshatch fabric of the grid overspread the island: a heavy greatcoat on the land, the dense undergarment of the future city.<br><br>No other grid in Western civilization was so large and uniform as the one ordained in 1811. Not without reason. When the grid plan was announced, New York was just under two hundred years old, an overgrown town at the southern tip of Manhattan, a notorious jumble of streets laid at the whim of landowners. To bring order beyond the chaos-and good real estate to market-the street planning commission came up with a monolithic grid for the rest of the island. Mannahatta-the native "island of hills"-became a place of rectangles, in thousands of blocks on the flattened landscape, and many more thousands of right-angled buildings rising in vertical mimicry.<br><br>The Manhattan grid has been called "a disaster" of urban planning and "the most courageous act of prediction in Western civilization." However one feels about it, the most famous urban design of a living city defines its daily life. This is its story.</p><p><b>Gerard Koeppel</b> is the author of <i>Bond of Union: Building the Erie Canal and the American Empire</i> and <i>Water for Gotham: A History</i>.

Lambert, like Deleuze, calls this &#x201c;the image of thought.&#x201d;</p><p>Lambert&#x2019;s exploration begins with Deleuze&#x2019;s earliest exposition of the Proustian image of thought and then follows the &#x201c;tangled history&#x201d; of the image that runs through subsequent works, such as <i>Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature</i>, <i>The Rhizome</i> (which serves as an introduction to Deleuze&#x2019;s<i> A Thousand Plateaus</i>), and several later writings from the 1980s collected in <i>Essays Critical and Clinical.</i> Lambert shows how this topic underlies Deleuze&#x2019;s studies of modern cinema, where the image of thought is predominant in the analysis of the cinematic image&#x2014;particularly in <i>The Time-Image</i>. Lambert finds it to be the fundamental concern of the brain proposed by Deleuze in the conclusion of <i>What Is Philosophy?<br><br></i>By connecting the various appearances of the image of thought that permeate Deleuze&#x2019;s entire corpus, Lambert reveals how thinking first assumes an image, how the images of thought become identified with the problem of expression early in the works, and how this issue turns into a primary motive for the more experimental works of philosophy written with Guattari. The study traces a distinctly modern relationship between philosophy and non-philosophy (literature and cinema especially) that has developed into a hallmark of the term &#x201c;Deleuzian.&#x201d; However, Lambert argues, this aspect of the philosopher&#x2019;s vision has not been fully appreciated in terms of its significance for philosophy: &#x201c;not only &#x2018;for today&#x2019; but, to quote Nietzsche, meaning also &#x2018;for tomorrow, and for the day after tomorrow.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br></p></p><p><p>Gregg Lambert is Dean&#x2019;s Professor of Humanities and founding director of the Humanities Center at Syracuse University.</p>"<i>In Search of a New Image of Thought</i> is an important and exciting study. As Gregg Lambert points out, the notion of the &#x2018;image of thought&#x2019; is of crucial importance in Deleuze&#x2019;s conception of philosophy; Lambert&#x2019;s approach to the concept via literary examples is ingenious, and as he builds his argument, the viability of that approach becomes increasingly persuasive. Lambert&#x2019;s readings of Deleuze&#x2019;s works are penetrating." &#x2014;Ronald Bogue, author of <i>Deleuze&#x2019;s Way: Essays in Transverse Ethics and Aesthetics </i><br></p><h2>The Last Great Ride</h2><p>The brain child behind the success of NBC Entertainment gives an anecdotal look at network television with stories about the making of such hits as &#34;Cheers&#34; and &#34;The Cosby Show&#34;</p><p>Brandon Tartikoff is chairman of Paramount Pictures.This account of Tartikoff's tenure as head of programming at NBC-TV from 1980 to 1991, during which time the network rose to and retained top ratings, offers primarily a string of "and then I developed . . . " stories. Tartikoff was responsible for NBC's airing of The Cosby Show , Hill Street Blues and The A-Team , among other highly successful series, and here, with freelance writer Leerhsen, he tells how he did it. Tartikoff provides particularly interesting material about the projects that were pitched to him by figures as notable as Marlon Brando and Frank Zappa, most of which he rejected, and about his relations with such industry tycoons as mentor Fred Silverman and MTM Productions wizard Grant Tinker. Tartikoff also tells of his mistakes, including the quickly-cancelled shows Manimal and Pink Lady and Jeff , plus his rejection of an opportunity to invest in the development of the chubby-faced Cabbage Patch Doll. His memoir chronicles significant TV history, but its scattershot style is off-putting. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American art nouveau</h2><p>Book by Johnson, Diane Chalmers</p><p></p><h2>The Chez Piggy Cookbook: Recipes From the Celebrated Restaurant and Bakery</h2><p><p><b> Viva Chez Piggy! </b></p><p> Located in the heart of Kingston, Ontario's historic downtown, the whimsically named Chez Piggy is the culinary offspring of Rose Richardson and Zal Yanovsky.

An early proponent of African unity and independence who claimed to be a descendant of King Solomon, he fought with the Allies against the Axis powers during World War II and was a messianic figure for the Jamaican Rastafarians.

Phormio. The Mother-In-Law. The Brothers (Loeb Classical Library No. 23)</h2><p><p>Terence brought to the Roman stage a bright comic voice and a refined sense of style. His six comedies--first produced in the half dozen years before his premature death in 159 BCE--were imaginatively reformulated in Latin plays written by Greek playwrights, especially Menander. For this new Loeb Classical Library edition of Terence, John Barsby gives us a faithful and lively translation with full explanatory notes, facing a freshly edited Latin text.</p><p>Volume I contains a substantial introduction and three plays: <i>The Woman of Andros</i>, a romantic comedy; <i>The Self-Tormentor</i>, which looks at contrasting father-son relationships; and <i>The Eunuch</i>, whose characters include the most sympathetically drawn courtesan in Roman comedy. The other three plays are in Volume II: <i>Phormio</i>, a comedy of intrigue with an engaging trickster; <i>The Mother-in-Law</i>, unique among Terence's plays in that the female characters are the admirable ones; and <i>The Brothers</i>, which explores contrasting approaches to parental education of sons.</p><p>The Romans highly praised Terence--"whose speech can charm, whose every word delights," in Cicero's words. This new edition of his plays, which replaces the now outdated Loeb translation by John Sargeaunt (first published in 1912), succeeds in capturing his polished style and appeal.</p></p><p><p>John Barsby is Professor of Classics at the University of Otago, New Zealand.</p></p><h2>Dark Redemption (American Mercenary)</h2><p><b>AN ASSASSIN ON THE BRINK OF DESTRUCTION.<br>THE LEADER OF A GLOBAL CRIME SYNDICATE.<br>AND THE MEETING OF TWO FATAL ENEMIES...</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>"A thrilling ride."</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><br><i>"Best book I have read in years."</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><br><i>"Kasper is the future of this genre."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>______________________________________________<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>David Rivers has returned from a brutal combat mission in Somalia with only one thing on his mind: revenge.

A close-knit community of German immigrants made an amazing claim: they had seen a young slave woman whom they were sure was the daughter of a relative who had sailed with them from Holland years earlier. After her parents died, the girl and her sister had been sent off to become indentured servants. No one knew what had happened to them, but the community was positive that the slave woman known as Mary or Brigit Wilson was really Salome Muller. Lawyers were assembled, and the battle lines were drawn. The Germans maintained that an unscrupulous former owner, John Fitz Miller, had enslaved an indentured child and later sold her to her current owner. Miller hired a "dream team" to press his claim that Mary was merely a clever slave, duping a bunch of credulous immigrants. Adding to the puzzle was her lack of memory of a German childhood and Miller's inability to prove that he had bought her. Bailey has provided a rich, vibrant New Orleans setting. Using court transcripts, pamphlets produced by both sides, newspaper stories, and biographies, he has produced a courtroom thriller with unexpected twists and turns. The details he includes about the horrors of the immigrant experience, and his discussions of laws governing slave owners, make this a valuable history lesson as well.<i>&#x2013;Kathy Tewell, Chantilly Regional Library, VA</i>Starred Review. Who was Sally Miller: was she Salom� M�ller, a long-lost German immigrant girl enslaved by a Southern planter? Or was she really a light-skinned black woman, shrewd enough to exploit her only opportunity for freedom? Bailey (<i>The White Diver of Broome</i>) keeps us guessing until the end in this page-turning true courtroom drama of 19th-century New Orleans. Bailey opens the story in 1843, when a friend of the Schubers&#x2014;a local family of German immigrants&#x2014;discovered Miller outside her owner Louis Belmonti's house. Struck by her remarkable resemblance to their late cousin Dorothea M�ller, and unusual birthmarks exactly like he daughter Salom�'s, the Schubers claimed Sally as kin and set about trying to prove her identity as Salom� and obtain her freedom. Bailey brings to life the fierce legal proceedings with vivid strokes. The case was controversial because it wasn't Belmonti but her previous owner, the perfect Southern gentleman John Fitz Miller, who faced disgrace if proved to have forced a white German girl into slavery. Bailey elucidates the bewildering array of possible identities turned up for Sally by numerous witnesses as well as the complexities of 19th-century Louisiana slave law and the status of black women. Sally herself remains an enigma at the center of this highly engrossing tale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The whole of the common characteristics with which heredity endows the individuals of a race constitute the genius of the race. When, however, a certain number of these individuals are gathered together in a crowd for purposes of action, observation proves that, from the mere fact of their being assembled, there result certain new psychological characteristics, which are added to the racial characteristics and differ from them at times to a very considerable degree.&#34;-From the Preface to &#34;The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind&#34;, a pivotal work in the field of group psychology which was written in 1895 by French social psychologist, Gustave Le Bon.</p><p><p> <em>Gustave LeBon </em>(1841-1931) was a French physician who wrote widely on scientific subjects, including anatomy and physiology, anthropology, and history.

Dunstan Prial's biography presents Hammond's life as a gripping story of music, money, fame, and racial conflict, played out in the nightclubs and recording studios where the music was made. <br>A pioneering producer and talent spotter, Hammond discovered and championed some of the most gifted musicians of early jazz&#x2014;Billie Holliday, Count Basie, Charlie Christian, Benny Goodman--and staged the legendary "From Spirituals to Swing" concert at Carnegie Hall in 1939, which established jazz as America's indigenous music. Then as jazz gave way to pop and rock Hammond repeated the trick, discovering Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, and Stevie Ray Vaughan in his life's extraordinary second act. <br>Dunstan Prial shows Hammond's life to be an effort to push past his privileged upbringing and encounter American society in all its rough-edged vitality. A Vanderbilt on his mother's side, Hammond grew up in a mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. As a boy, he would sneak out at night and go uptown to Harlem to hear jazz in speakeasies. As a young man, he crusaded for racial equality in the music world and beyond. And as a Columbia Records executive&#x2014;a dapper figure behind the glass of the recording studio or in a crowded nightclub&#x2014;he saw music as the force that brought whites and blacks together and expressed their shared sense of life's joys and sorrows. This first biography of John Hammond is also a vivid and up-close account of great careers in the making: Bob Dylan recording his first album with Hammond for $402, Bruce Springsteen showing up at Hammond's office carrying a beat-up acoustic guitar without a case. In Hammond's life, the story of American music is at once personal and epic: the story of a man at the center of things, his ears wide open.<br></p><p><b>Dunstan Prial</b>, born in New Jersey in 1970, has worked as a reporter with the <i>Associated Press</i>, and was led to Hammond's career by his admiration for Bruce Springsteen. He lives in Bristol, Rhode Island.<br>Late in the evening of July 7, 1957, Count Basie and his orchestra took the stage to wrap up that year's Newport Jazz Festival. The all-black band was introduced by a tall, skinny, crew-cut white guy with a voice so plummy as to border on unintentional self-parody. I was there and remember it vividly, but anybody can hear it on the album "Basie at Newport," and to this day almost everybody is likely to agree that the contrast between the Manhattanite voice and the down-home Kansas City band is just about too exquisitely hilarious to be true.<p>But it was, and is, no joke. The speaker was John Hammond, and he deserved to be there. Though little-known beyond the innermost circles of American popular music, Hammond was a man of almost incalculable influence on that music. Twenty years earlier, after hearing the Basie band on the radio -- the band was celebrated in Kansas City but otherwise obscure -- Hammond had driven to Missouri from New York specifically to offer his services as producer, booker and just about everything else, not for the money it might make for him but because he believed Basie and his band deserved and must be presented to a larger audience. For this Basie remained grateful ever after, which is why he was no doubt delighted to be led onstage in Newport by his old benefactor and friend.</p><p>It could be said that Hammond spent almost his entire life leading musicians onstage. Born in December 1910 into a wealthy New York family -- his mother was a Vanderbilt -- Hammond rarely had more than fleeting financial worries throughout his 76-year life and was free to concentrate his very considerable energies on the two causes with which he was obsessed: American popular music, jazz most particularly, and civil rights for African Americans. As a boy he was steered toward classical music by his mother, but he was far more interested in the music sung and played by the servants, many of whom were black. Dunstan Prial writes:</p><p>"As Hammond observed in his memoirs, as well as in numerous interviews, he sensed from an early age that there was a reason this music was as deeply passionate as it was. It was uniquely American music, written by and played for people who had known the harsher realities of life firsthand. In particular, it was music by and for people whose skin color kept them perpetually at the bottom rung of American society. Listening to this music helped awaken Hammond to the vast class differences that separated him from the servants in the basement." </p><p>Hammond was barely out of knee-pants before he started venturing to Harlem, where musicians and nightclub operators seem to have adopted him as an odd but agreeable mascot. He attended prep school at Hotchkiss and college at Yale, but his inner compass was trained on the jazz clubs and recording studios of New York. By the time he was 20, he "had been listening to and collecting jazz records for ten years" and felt he was ready to start producing records himself. The first session he presided over, featuring a pianist named Garland Wilson, provoked little interest, but it pointed him in the direction he followed for the rest of his life. Eventually he became perhaps the most influential talent scout and producer in the history of American popular music, not because the musicians he sponsored always enjoyed huge success but because he had an absolutely uncanny ear.</p><p>Over the years he earned a huge reputation, "not only by being in the right place at the right time -- he was at Monette's in Harlem in 1933 the night Billie Holiday performed there, he was at Mildred Bailey's home in Queens the night Teddy Wilson and Benny Goodman first jammed as part of a trio, and he was in Oklahoma City long enough to hear Charlie Christian knock out a handful of tasty guitar solos -- but also for knowing what to do when opportunity came knocking." He rushed Holiday into the studio when she was an unknown kid and set up some of her most important early recordings; he boosted Goodman when the band leader was still feeling his way and was instrumental in setting up Goodman's alliances with Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton; then, after a long dry period when jazz seemed to have passed him by, he reversed gears and almost literally gave the world Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen.</p><p>His greatest period was the 1930s, when he was still in his twenties, bursting with the youthful enthusiasm that he never really lost -- a case can be made, in fact, that through all his mature years he was an arrested adolescent -- and making discovery after discovery. As Prial says: "The list of musicians he brought together for recording dates in the 1930s is staggering. Contemporary jazz historians can only shake their heads at the thought of walking into a studio in midtown Manhattan and finding Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman, Lester Young, Teddy Wilson, Buck Clayton, Freddie Green, Walter Page, and Jo Jones . . . . 'It astonishes me, as I look back, at how casually we were able to assemble such all-star groups. It wasn't that we didn't know how great they were. We did. It was simply a Golden Age,' Hammond recalled in his memoirs." </p><p>It was, of course, the Golden Age of Swing, and all his life Hammond was a swing man. When the boppers came along in the 1940s, Hammond "appreciated the rebellion inherent in the music, [but] found the music itself impenetrable and ultimately pretentious." By the mid-1950s, though he introduced Basie at Newport and otherwise made his presence felt, Hammond had been left behind. He didn't recover until Columbia Records rehired him in late 1959, and his recovery went in a direction that no one possibly could have predicted, Hammond himself included.</p><p>It is here, with Hammond's discovery and/or sponsorship of Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Ray Vaughan, that The Producer really comes to life. Prial, a freelance journalist, became interested in Hammond's story after learning about his relationship with Springsteen. He worked hard to bone up on Hammond's earlier life in jazz, but he relies too much on secondary sources -- in particular James Lincoln Collier's often wrong-headed biography of Benny Goodman -- and one senses that he's going through the motions. When it comes to the music of his own generation, though, Prial writes with knowledge and feeling. He also had the good fortune to get an extensive interview with Springsteen, who speaks eloquently about Hammond in words that doubtless could just as well have been spoken by Count Basie or Charlie Christian:</p><p>"He was somebody I felt that my music was very safe with. He just exuded love of music. The minute he heard something he liked he was capable of expressing such enthusiasm. . . . When there were no clich�s in the songs, when it's all you, when it's all yours, when he's hearing something he hasn't quite heard before. That's what he looked for. That's what moved him. A singular voice, some sort of distinctive voice that came from some place particular and spoke with a certain sort of emotional force." </p><p>As to Hammond the man, he seems to have been an odd duck who could invest emotion in music that he couldn't find for intimate relationships. His commitment to civil rights was deep and passionate, yet he was also a haute WASP who may have inherited some of the prejudices of his class. How else to explain Hammond's lifelong unhappiness that Benny Goodman married his sister: Goodman, after all, was both a musician and a Jew, which seems not to have occurred to Prial but which may explain Hammond's opposition to a marriage that brought unwelcome strains of the outside world into his hermetic family. Once an aristo, always an aristo, and no amount of down-home American music is likely to change that. </p><p>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Well-connected society men who also showed remarkable foresight in business, Cross &amp; Cross supported their practice with a partnered real estate firm and played a vital role in residential developments like Sutton Place along the East River. <br> &nbsp;<br> Cross &amp; Cross oversaw the development of handsome clubs and houses throughout New York City, including the Links Club and the Upper East Side houses of Lewis Spencer Morris and George Whitney. They designed country houses in exclusive residential pockets outside New York&#x2014;the Southampton estate of Winterthur founder Henry Francis du Pont; houses on the North Shore of Long Island, and in Greenwich, Connecticut; the childhood home of Sister Parish in Far Hills, New Jersey; and the Shelburne, Vermont home of J. Watson and Electra Webb. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> In this first book to collect the achievements of Cross &amp; Cross, Peter Pennoyer and Anne Walker present a comprehensive monograph of the firm&#x2019;s work, with more than 300 illustrations both historic and new and a catalogue raisonn� of their projects.</p><p>Peter Pennoyer is the founding partner of Peter Pennoyer Architects, which has produced award-winning projects worldwide in classical and traditional styles. The firm is one of <i>Architectural Digest</i>&#x2019;s AD 100 list of top architects and designers. He serves as the chairman of the Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art and as a trustee of the Morgan Library &amp; Museum.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anne Walker is an architectural historian with Peter Pennoyer Architects. She has worked with Pennoyer on three earlier monographs, covering the work of the firms Delano &amp; Aldrich, Warren &amp; Wetmore, and Grosvenor Atterbury.&#x201c;Eliot and John W. Cross were the perfect patrician designers. They put their Ivy League and Beaux-Arts connections into play in 1907, and quickly gained a practice in discreet townhouses, clubs, country houses and jewel-like banks. But the sumptuous illustrations also show an unexpected aspect of their career in the late 1920s, as they developed a specialty of flashy skyscrapers in devoutly modernistic style. The photographer for the book, Jonathan Wallen, took spectacular close-ups of the spiky, vibrating tower [the RCA Victor building] that show things you&#x2019;d never imagine from the street: incised brickwork, explosive medallions, chevrons and stylized, masklike faces. The RCA Victor building gives the Chrysler Building a run for its money.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Visitors snap photos of Tiffany's windows on New York's Fifth Avenue every day, but how many look up at the dignified 1940 building that rises above? The office towers, banks, luxury apartment houses, and country estates built by architect brothers John Walter and Eliot Cross hide in plain sight, frequently upstaged by showier modernist neighbors. <i>New York Transformed</i>&nbsp;draws the spotlight back to the work of these forgotten masters, from Mayfields, an idyllic 1921 New Jersey mansion that became the home of future designer Sister Parish (who termed the house 'perfection'), to the 'great symmetrical palazzo' of One Sutton Place South in Manhattan (1926). Proof that these traditionalists had a wild side can be found the fantastical gothic effigies atop their 1931 General Electric skyscraper.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Elle Decor</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Architect brothers John and Eliot Cross helped forge the Manhattan skyline we know and love today. If you've ever stepped into Tiffany &amp; Co. on Fifth Avenue, you've been in one of the Crosses' stately structures. This is a beautiful survey of the brothers' work.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Traditional Home</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Before New York was a city of international billionaires hiding&nbsp;ill-gotten gains in spindly glass towers, it was the skyscraper capital&nbsp;of the world, a city striving to reach high and scratch an indelible&nbsp;image of its ambition, worldliness, and cultural solidity right onto the&nbsp;sky. In <i>New York Transformed</i>, Peter Pennoyer and Anne Walker make&nbsp;tangible the energy and verve of the moment when the patrician&nbsp;architect-developers Cross &amp; Cross helped create that magical, magnetic&nbsp;Metropolis. Imbued with a keen understanding of the links between feeling&nbsp;and building, identity and masonry, the wants of mere men and the needs&nbsp;of mankind, their latest book is as important as it is compelling.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Michael Gross, author of <i>740 Park</i> and <i>House of Outrageous Fortune</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Pennoyer and Walker bring the versatile Cross Brothers to life and shine a spotlight on their many handsome&#x2014;sometimes dramatic&#x2014;New York buildings. Many may know them from the dazzling GE Building on Lexington Avenue. But I was surprised that so many of my other favorites, from City Bank Farmers Trust Company and 41 Broad in Lower Manhattan, to the Links Club and Tiffany's, were Cross and Cross designed. What a welcome addition to any architecture buff's library.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;<b>Peg Breen, President, The New York Landmarks Conservancy</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What a delightful surprise! A practicing architect who's not only interested in history but writes it. Architect Peter Pennoyer and historian Anne Walker's new book on Cross and Cross resuscitates an architectural firm that strode the fertile territory between the traditional and the modern, providing a valuable lesson for architects today.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;<b>Donald Albrecht, Curator of Architecture and Design, Museum of the City of New York</b></p><h2>High School Musical: The Essential Guide</h2><p>With photographs from the movies, information on favorite characters, and behind-the-scenes access to East High, Lava Springs, and more, this guide gives fans the inside scoop on Troy, Gabriella, Sharpay, Ryan, Taylor, and Chad as they face graduation and prepare for college. 75,000 first printing.</p><p></p><h2>Cities of the Red Night: A Novel</h2><p>While young men wage war against an evil empire of zealous mutants, the population of this modern inferno is afflicted with the epidemic of a radioactive virus.

G. Wells' 1895 classic <em>The Time Machine</em>, readers of science fiction have puzzled over the paradoxes of time travel. What would happen if a time traveler tried to change history? Would some force or law of nature prevent him? Or would his action produce a "new" history, branching away from the original?In the last decade of the twentieth century a group of theoretical physicists at the California Institute of Technology undertook a serious investigation of the possibility of pastward time travel, inspiring a serious and sustained study that engaged more than thirty physicists working at universities and institutes around the world.Many of the figures involved are familiar: Einstein, Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne; others are names known mostly to physicists. These are the new time travelers, and this is the story of their work--a profoundly human endeavor marked by advances, retreats, and no small share of surprises. It is a fantastic journey to the frontiers of physics. 15 illustrations</p><p>David Toomey is a professor of English and director of the Professional Writing and Technical Communication Program at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. He lives in Amherst.According to Toomey, professor of English who teaches technical and nonfiction writing at the University of Massachusetts&#x2013;Amherst, the concept of time travel successfully made the transition from science fiction to the research literature of physics about 20 years ago. This is not to say that physicists uncritically accept the idea but simply that it is now a topic for rigorous scientific discussion. Because Toomey (Stormchasers) spends as much time describing the personalities of those investigating this odd field as he does the subject's technical aspects, he is able to bring the topic fully to life. The contributions made by Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan and Kip Thorne, in addition to other lesser-known physicists, are described, but even the author's fine writing is not able to make all of the highly technical material easily understood. Given that time travel, if it can occur at all, is likely to involve wormholes and worldlines, multiverses and Minkowski diagrams, as well as negative energy and naked singularities, this is not surprising. Toomey is at his best treating the many paradoxes that time travel engenders and exploring the ways around them, from Hawking's chronology protection conjecture to David Deutsch's creation of multiple universes. While physicists have, to date, been unable to demonstrate that any laws of nature make time travel impossible, Toomey makes it clear that we shouldn't expect to make such a trip any time soon. 15 illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chosen as the European Union&#x2019;s symbolic capital in 1958, this elusive setting has never been examined so intricately in literature. Translated with "zest, pace and wit" (<em>Spectator</em>) by Jamie Bulloch, Robert Menasse's <em>The Capital</em> plays out the effects of a fiercely nationalistic &#x201c;union.&#x201d;<br><br> Recalling the Balzacian conceit of assembling a vast parade of characters whose lives conspire to form a driving central plot, Menasse adapts this technique with modern sensibility to reveal the hastily assembled capital in all of its eccentricities. We meet, among others, Fenia Xenopoulou, a Greek Cypriot recently &#x201c;promoted&#x201d; to the Directorate-General for Culture. When tasked with revamping the boring image of the European Commission with the Big Jubilee Project, she endorses her Austrian assistant Martin Sussman&#x2019;s idea to proclaim Auschwitz as its birthplace&#x2015;of course, to the horror of the other nation states. Meanwhile, Inspector �mile Brunfaut attempts to solve a gritty murder being suppressed at the highest level; Matek, a Polish hitman who regrets having never become a priest, scrambles after taking out the wrong man; and outraged pig farmers protest trade restrictions as a brave escapee squeals through the streets.<br><br> These narratives and more are masterfully woven, revealing the absurdities&#x2015;and real dangers&#x2015;of a fracturing Europe. A tour de force from one of Austria&#x2019;s most esteemed novelists, <em>The Capital</em> is a mordantly funny and piercingly urgent saga of the European Union, and an aerial feat of sublime world literature.</p><p><p><strong>Robert Menasse</strong> is an Austrian writer and essayist. His work has received various awards, including the European Book Prize and the prestigious German Book Prize.</p><p><strong>Jamie Bulloch</strong> is a historian and translator of German literature. He won the Schlegel-Tieck Prize for his translation of <em>The Mussel Feast</em>.<br></p>&#x201c;Drolly comic... I enjoyed <em>The Capital</em> so much...A major book about coincidences, of linked and overlapping meanings...This is a deeply humane novel, a novel for adults. It carries the wisdom and weight and weariness of late middle age. Menasse writes not about the way things should be but about the way things are, rare enough these days. The translation, by Jamie Bulloch, is adroit. Yet <em>The Capital</em> made me want to learn to read in German, where it is surely even better.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dwight Garner, <i>New York Times</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] stinging office satire... A Joseph Heller-like funhouse of bureaucratic cul-de-sacs, interdepartmental squabbling, nonsensical regulations and embarrassing acronyms... Jamie Bulloch provides the excellent translation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sam Sachs, <em><i>Wall Street Journal</i></em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A brutally funny and exhaustive tableau of both a continent in transition and the organization straining to hold it together.... Menasse writes with a wry, self-deprecating touch. He turns what might have been a dry lecture into a teeming epic that brings to multi-textured life a continent undergoing an identity crisis.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew R. Chow, <em>TIME</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Witty but humane.... The massive cast never becomes unwieldy tanks to Menasse&#x2019;s delightful prose. This epic, droll account of contemporary Europe will be catnip for fans of mosaic novels and comical political machinations.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><i>Publishers Weekly</i> [starred review]</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The first great EU novel.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Politico</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Like Musil in <em>The Man Without Qualities</em>, [Menasse] has fun with efforts to organize something grand to celebrate an anniversary, here the 50th of the European Commission's founding (he even parodies that book's opening passage).... [An] ambitious panorama that arrives amid the throes of Brexit and the Chinese Year of the Pig. Intelligent, fun, sad, insightful&#x2015;an exceptional work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><i>Kirkus Reviews</i> [starred review]</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A thoroughly entertaining fiction that serves both as a sort of campus satire and a novel of ideas.... With its zest, pace and wit, Jamie Bulloch&#x2019;s translation serves him [Menasse] splendidly.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Boyd Tonkin, <i>The Spectator</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Utterly unique.... In constantly blending styles and genres, Menasse captures the wonderful diversity of cultures that the EU has brought together. Winner of the German Book Prize, this is part celebration of the EU and part farce, a strange, timely novel emphasizing the benefits of international institutions at precisely a moment when they are increasingly under stress.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alexander Moran, <i>Booklist</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A first-class read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mischievous yet profound.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Economist</em></strong></p><h2>Kitchen Expedition</h2><p>Hardcover, as pictured (ck)</p><p></p><h2>Spurgeon</h2><p>Book by Dallimore, Arnold A</p><p>Arnold A.

But Amy soon learns Spartan is not the only who has wounds yet to heal. Although Amy is helping out with the horses at Heartland again, she is still weighted by a sense of guilt for her mother&#39;s death. And she misses her mum too much to dismiss her fear that she was responsible for the trailer crash. Furthermore, Amy&#39;s trying to care for Spartan, the horse they saved before the accident, but Spartan is an everyday reminder of the wreck and how it changed everything. And for Spartan, Amy is a reminder of the crash as well - no matter what attempts she makes , Spartan is vicious towards her. At the very sight of her he lashes out, rearing defiantly and baring his teeth. Faulting herself, Amy feels she can&#39;t blame Spartan for hating her. Then she realises Spartan will never forgive her until she forgives herself.</p><p>Amy Fleming is a talented young rider and horse trainer whose mother recently died while trying to rescue an abandoned stallion. Amy's mom was a famous horse trainer who founded Heartland, a horse-training center for abused, neglected, and problem horses. In the weeks following her mother's death, Amy, her older sister Lou, and their grandpa try to cope with the sudden loss of the woman who was the heart of Heartland, but they're overwhelmed by the pressures of running the horse farm while dealing with their grief. Fifteen-year-old Amy focuses on training Spartan, the horse she and her mom were trying to rescue, and achieves spectacular results as he turns out to be a talented jumper. Lou tries to take over the business side of the farm, but Amy fights every change she tries to make, even though Heartland needs Lou's guidance and business sense to survive. Over the course of the summer, Amy and Lou learn to respect each other's talents and contributions, and they strike a new balance that will enable Heartland to continue its work of "healing horses, healing hearts."<p> Horse lovers who liked the movie <i>The Horse Whisperer</i> will appreciate the descriptions of training methods and alternative therapies used at Heartland.

A family home. And even when a family home is empty it has an echo of life. It shouldn&#x2019;t sit, heavy and foreboding with a thick, suffocating blanket of silence like this house does. <br> &nbsp;<br> Still, he calls again. &#x201c;Hello. Anyone here?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Cheryl raises a hand and raps briskly against the open door. Shut when they arrived, but unlocked. Again, not right. Arnhill might be a small village but people still lock their doors. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Police!&#x201d; she shouts. <br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing. Not a faint footstep, creak or whisper. Gary sighs, realizing he feels superstitiously reluctant about entering. Not just because of the rancid aroma of death. There&#x2019;s something else. Something primal that seems to be urging him to turn and walk away, right now. <br> &nbsp;<br> Sarge?&#x201d; Cheryl looks up at him, one pencil-thin eyebrow raised questioningly. <br> &nbsp;<br> He glances at his five-foot-four, barely-breaking-one-hundred pounds companion. At over six foot and almost two hundred eighty pounds, Gary is the Baloo to Cheryl&#x2019;s delicate Bambi. At least, in looks. Personality-wise, suffice it to say, Gary cries at Disney movies. <br> &nbsp;<br> He gives her a small, grim nod and the pair step inside. <br> &nbsp;<br> The ripe, rich smell of human decay is overwhelming. Gary swallows, trying to breathe through his mouth, wishing fervently that someone else&#x2014;<i>anyone else</i>&#x2014;could have taken this call. Cheryl pulls a disgusted face and covers her nose with her hand. <br> &nbsp;<br> These small cottages are fairly typical in layout. Small hallway. Stairs to the left. Living room to the right and a tiny kitchen tacked on the back. Gary turns toward the living room. Pushes open the door. <br> &nbsp;<br> Gary has seen dead bodies before. A young kid killed by a hit-and-run driver. A teenager mangled in farm equipment. They were horrible, yes. Needless, most definitely. But this. This is bad, he thinks again. Really bad. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;F***,&#x201d; Cheryl whispers, and Gary couldn&#x2019;t have put it better himself. <br> &nbsp;<br> Everything conveyed in that single appalled expletive. <i>F***</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> A woman is slumped on a worn leather sofa in the middle of the room, facing a large flatscreen TV. The TV has a spiderweb crack in its front around which dozens of fat bluebottles crawl lazily. <br> &nbsp;<br> The rest buzz around the woman. <i>The body</i>, Gary corrects himself. Not a person anymore. Just a corpse. Just another case. Pull it together. <br> &nbsp;<br> Despite the bloating of putrefaction he can tell that in life she had probably been slim, with pale skin, now mottled and marbled with green veins. She is dressed well. Checked shirt, fitted jeans and leather boots. Telling her age is difficult, mainly because most of the top of her head is missing. Well, not exactly missing. He can see chunks of it stuck to the wall and the bookcase and the cushions. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not much doubt about who pulled the trigger. The shotgun still rests in her lap, bloated fingers bulging around it. Quickly, Gary assesses what must have happened. Gun inserted into her mouth, pulls the trigger, bullet exits slightly to the left, as that&#x2019;s where the worst damage is, which makes sense, as the gun is in her right hand. <br> &nbsp;<br> Gary is only a uniformed sergeant and doesn&#x2019;t have a lot to do with forensics, but he does watch a lot of <i>CSI</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Decomposition probably occurred quite rapidly. It&#x2019;s hot in the little cottage, stifling in fact. The temperature outside is mid-seventies, the windows are shut and, although the curtains are pulled, it must be creeping up to ninety. He can already feel the sweat trickling down his back and dampening his underarms. Cheryl, who never loses her cool, is wiping her forehead and looking uncomfortable. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shit. What a mess,&#x201d; she says, with a weariness he doesn&#x2019;t often hear. <br> &nbsp;<br> She stares at the body on the sofa, shaking her head, then her eyes shift around the rest of the room, lips pursed, face grim. Gary knows what she is thinking. <i>Nice cottage. Nice car. Nice clothes. But you never really know.</i> <i>You never really know what goes on inside</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> Apart from the leather sofa the only other furniture is a heavy oak bookcase, a small coffee table and the TV. He looks at it again, wondering about the crack in the screen and why the flies are so interested in crawling all over it. He takes a few steps forward, broken glass crunching beneath his feet, and bends down. <br> &nbsp;<br> Closer, he spots the reason. The splintered glass is covered in dark, crusted blood. More has run down the screen to the floor, where, he realizes, he has only just avoided standing in a sticky puddle that has spread over the floorboards. <br> &nbsp;<br> Cheryl moves to stand beside him. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that? Blood?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> He thinks about the bike. The rain boots. The silence. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We need to check the rest of the cottage,&#x201d; he says. She looks at him with troubled eyes and nods. <br> &nbsp;<br> The stairs are steep, creaky and streaked with more trails of dark blood. At the top a narrow landing leads to two bedrooms and a tiny bathroom. If possible, the heat on the landing is more intense, the smell even more repugnant. Gary gestures for Cheryl to go and check the bathroom. For a moment he thinks she&#x2019;ll argue. It&#x2019;s obvious that the smell is coming from one of the bedrooms but, for once, she lets him play the senior officer and walks cautiously across the landing. <br> &nbsp;<br> He faces the first bedroom door, a bitter metallic taste in his mouth, and then, slowly, eases it open. It&#x2019;s a woman&#x2019;s room. Clean, neat and empty. Wardrobe in one corner, chest of drawers by the window, large bed covered with a pristine cream duvet. On the bedside table, a lamp and a solitary picture in a plain wooden frame. He walks over and picks it up. A young boy, ten or eleven, small and wiry, with a toothy smile and messy blond hair. Oh God, he finds himself praying. <i>Please, God, no</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> With an even heavier heart he walks back out into the corridor to find Cheryl looking pale and tense. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Bathroom&#x2019;s empty,&#x201d; she says, and he knows that she is thinking the same thing. Only one room left. Only one door to open to reveal the grand prize. He angrily swats away a fly and would have taken a steadying breath if the smell hadn&#x2019;t already been choking him. Instead, he reaches for the handle and pushes the door open. <br> &nbsp;<br> Cheryl is too tough to be sick, but he still hears her make a retching noise. His own stomach gives a good solid heave but he manages to fight the nausea back down. <br> &nbsp;<br> When he thought this was bad, he was wrong. This is a f***ing nightmare. <br> &nbsp;<br> The boy lies on his bed, dressed in an oversized T-shirt, baggy shorts and white sports socks. The elastic of the socks digs into the swollen flesh of his legs. <br> &nbsp;<br> Bright white socks, Gary can&#x2019;t help noticing. Blindingly white. Fresh-on white. Like a detergent ad. Or perhaps they just seem that way because everything else is red. Dark red. Streaking the oversized T- shirt, smeared all over the pillows and sheets. And where the boy&#x2019;s face should be just a big mushy mess of red, features indiscernible, crawling with busy black bodies, flies and beetles, wriggling in and out of the ruined flesh. His mind flicks back to the splintered TV screen and the puddle of blood on the floor, and suddenly he sees it. The boy&#x2019;s head being smashed into the TV again and again, then hammered into the floor until he is unrecognizable, until he has no face. <br> &nbsp;<br> And maybe that was the point, he thinks, as he raises his eyes to the other red. The most obvious red. The red it is impossible to miss. Big letters scrawled across the wall above the boy&#x2019;s body: <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>NOT MY SON</b></p><h2>Simeon&#39;s Story: An Eyewitness Account of the Kidnapping of Emmett Till</h2><p><p>No modern tragedy has had a greater impact on race relations in America than the kidnapping and murder of Emmett Till. A 14-year-old black boy from Chicago visiting relatives in Mississippi in 1955, Till was taken from his uncle&#x2019;s home by two white men; several days later, his body was found in the Tallahatchie River. This grotesque crime became the catalyst for the civil rights movement.</p><p>At age 12, author Simeon Wright<b> </b>saw and heard his cousin Emmett whistle at a white woman at a grocery store; he was sleeping in the same bed with him when Emmett was taken; and he was at the sensational trial. This is his gripping coming-of-age memoir.</p></p><p><p><b>Simeon Wright </b>is a popular public speaker at schools, churches, and cultural institutions throughout the country. <b>Herb Boyd</b> has published 20 books, including <i>We Shall Overcome: The History of the Civil Rights Movement as It Happened</i>.</p>Units on the civil rights movement would be remiss not to include this powerful firsthand account. Wright was there when his cousin Till whistled at white cashier Carolyn Bryant; he shared the same bed as Till when two white men burst into the house to drag him away; and he was witness to the decades of scrutiny the case has wrought. Wright focuses on the crime with clarity and passion. His memoir is short and focused, with just enough context about living in Jim Crow Mississippi and, later, about how the incident colored his reactions to Dr. King and Malcolm X. His ground-level insights into the character of 14-year-old Bobo (We didn&#x2019;t know that Bobo&#x2019;s first name was Emmett until after he was killed) are invaluable. In many ways, this is a book about the value of primary sources; Wright (along with coauthor Boyd) spends many pages sifting through erroneous stories. The 2005 exhumation, the 2005 documentary The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till, and the 2008 Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act are also given consideration.

He lives in West Sussex, England.When Theo Sinclair was nine years old, in 1943, he fell in love with a girl of 20 named Barbara Lockwood, who killed herself. Now it's 1964, and Theo is teaching undergraduate history courses at the University of Reading, England. He's only 29, but already a confirmed bachelor and curmudgeon. Theo's humdrum life is shattered by the appearance of Alice Ashenfelter, a beautiful young American whose father was hanged for the murder provoked by Barbara's suicide. Alice is determined to prove that justice miscarried, and finds ways to engage Theo in her cause. Suddenly, as the pair investigate the old mystery, there's a new murder, then a third. Lovesey deftly builds suspense as the plot unfolds, and his slam-bang finish is altogether satisfying. Quirky and entertaining characters give added depth to this corker of a novel.

In response, the well-known Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal vowed to prove Anne's story true by finding the Gestapo officer who'd arrested her and her family. Much detective work led to the 1963 discovery of the man in question. This "hook" is the framing story for a picture-book biography chronicling Wiesenthal's experiences during World War II and illustrating the development of his unusual career. The book is meticulously researched and packed with dates, facts, and quotes from the subject and others. Back matter includes an overview of Wiesenthal's life. The amount of detail, while admirably scholarly, makes the text rather dense and dry, and casual readers will find it slowgoing. Farnsworth's dark, realistic paintings are quietly dignified. The scenes have a cinematic drama in their use of lighting and in the contrasts between long shots and close-ups. This book is highly recommended for Holocaust collections, but it will be best appreciated by sophisticated readers or those with an already strong interest in the subject.&#x2014;<i>Heidi Estrin, Feldman Children's Library at Congregation B'nai Israel, Boca Raton, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Formerly environment correspondent of The Times, for the last ten years he has been environment editor of the Independent. He has three times been named as Environment Reporter of The Year. In 2007 he was awarded the Medal of the RSPB, for an outstanding contribution to conservation. This was the only occasion in the 100-year history of the RSPB Medal that it has been awarded to a journalist.McCarthy&#39;s words ring out as a rallying cry which is not only a delight to hear but one we should all seek to follow * Conversation * Compelling . . . The Moth Snowstorm is an inspiring book * New York Times Book Review * Offers a necessary corrective * Irish Times, Books of the Year * Elegiac * Guardian * This is a book about the joy the natural world can engender - even in the face of its decline. McCarthy synthesises the two main literary reposnses to the current crisis, provoking shock at the scale of Britain&#39;s recent loss of abundance and a sense of awe and (most importantly) love that may prove nature&#39;s best defence. If you read one book from this selection make it The Moth Snowstorm * The Times, Books of the Year * Unquestionably my nature book of the year - an intensely moving and intelligent plea for &#39;joy&#39; to be counted the most powerful reason for valuing the natural world. McCarthy&#39;s starting point is the vivid recollection of a veritable snowstorm of moths in car headlights when he was young. With glorious originality, he makes an unanswerable case for us to start proclaiming &#39;a new kind of love&#39; from the rooftops. Can you attach a cost-benefit analysis to what a walk in fields listening to birdsong can do for the human spirit? No. That&#39;s why everybody should read this angry, beautiful and passionate book * Daily Mail * [A] moving memoir * New Statesman * A bold new defence of a natural world under great threat * BBC Countryfile Magazine * I found joy following McCarthy&#39;s stories, particularly those of the futile attempts to return salmon to the Thames and the tragic loss of sparrows from London . . . His personal revelations are moving, and The Moth Snowstorm left me as grief-stricken as any environmental journalist must be after a career digesting facts such as that, by 2020, the volume of urban rubbish generated in China is expected to reach 400m tonnes - equivalent to the entire world&#39;s trash in 1997 * Guardian * A mixture of memoir, elegy to nature, and a call to arms . . . this is a profound urgent book, among its strength an appreciation of the small things - the common precious treasures of birdsong, butterflies and moths that we all, whatever our stance, stand to lose * Country Life * In his beautiful book . . . Michael McCarthy suggests that a capacity to love the natural world, rather than merely to exist within it, might be a uniquely human trait * Guardian * More than a simple paean to the glories of the wild world. It is also an impassioned protest against its destruction * Daily Mail * You could do worse to catch up than to read a single chapter in Michael McCarthy&#39;s new book, The Moth Snowstorm . . . the one entitled &#39;The Great Thinning&#39; . . . powerfully and succinctly summarises the unfolding national story * New Statesman * As much as joy, it&#39;s a beautiful book about love, damage, and the possibility of redemption * Press Association * A deeply troubling book by one of Britain&#39;s foremost journalists on the politics of nature. The case he lays bare in the opening chapters is compelling stuff. Essentially he argues that the world of wild creatures, plants, trees and whole habitats - you name it - is going to Hell in a handcart . . . powerful, heartfelt and compelling * The Spectator * The natural world, whether birdsong, butterflies or wild flowers, can give us joy. It can bring us peace. The ability of nature to do this, through a sense of awe, is articulated beautifully in a book by Michael McCarthy, The Moth Snowstorm: Nature and Joy. His quest to track down every British butterfly as a tribute to his dead mother brought me to tears * Sunday Times * Environmental correspondent Michael McCarthy makes an impassioned plea on behalf of the natural world in this inspiring book * Sunday Express * Deserves to be widely read * Scotsman * McCarthy has for years been the doyen of environmental correspondents . . . he is conversant with the hard facts, the political realities and the moral complexities of the conservation world. But he writes also as a man inspired by the beauty, diversity and abundance of the natural world that we are destroying. This combination of worldly wisdom and deeply felt personal experience makes this a highly original and refreshing account of our current predicament * TLS * A fascinating and very readable book . . . full of joy and wonder and luminous moments . . . McCarthy is a man who remembers not only the Observer&#39;s Book of Birds but the set of Brooke Bond tea cards featuring Charles Tunnicliffe&#39;s beautiful bird pictures. But you don&#39;t have to be of a similar vintage to enjoy this expansive celebration of a subject too often overlooked in the ongoing discourse about man and nature - sheer joy * Dabbler * Impassioned, polemical and personal . . . In the autobiographical passages nature is a marvel and a solace. [McCarthy&#39;s] descriptions of the night-time clouds of moths - the moth snowstorms of the title - that we saw in the days before farming ruined so much natural habitat are unforgettable, and his recollections of boyhood bird-watching on the River Dee Bay a delight . . . At its heart, this is a book aiming to persuade those who are broadly sympathetic to think in a different way, and in that it is surely a success - and a joy * Independent * An important book about an important subject - the loss of biodiversity locally, nationally and internationally, what this means for humanity and how it could possibly be avoided . . . The main argument is that we all have in us the capacity to experience joy and wonder from nature . . . Michael McCarthy is a professional journalist and an accomplished and experienced writer who handles his themes skilfully * Irish Examiner * A great, rhapsodic, urgent book full of joy, grief, rage and love. The Moth Snowstorm is at once a deeply affecting memoir and a heartbreaking account of ecological impoverishment. It fights against indifference, shines with the deep magic and beauty of the non-human lives around us, and shows how their loss lessens us all.

First published in 1977, it faithfully follows the plot of the film, including the much-talked about 'missing scenes'--one early in the story on Tatooine where Luke Skywalker meets up with his friend Biggs, now graduated from the Academy and off to join the rebels, and the scene between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt, which was reinstated in the Special Edition. Like the film, the book starts slowly, but builds to an exciting climax which transfers surprisingly well to the printed page, as the rebel forces, led by Luke, attempt to destroy the Empire's Death Star.<p>Readers of more recent Star Wars novels may be surprised by the generally uncomplimentary descriptions of the various alien characters. Later writers have taken their diversity much more seriously than Lucas seems to do here. However, all the familiar faces are in place, and it's fun to see people like Wedge Antilles, who has become so central in the X-Wing novels, here in their first bit parts. This is the adventure that started it all, and if you enjoy Star Wars novels, it's well worth re-reading. --<i>Elizabeth Sourbut</i></p>1998 Lucasfilm Ltd.

Without at first a suspicion of anything supernatural, on a sudden I saw an old man, rather stout and square, in a sort of roan-red dressing-gown, and with a black cap on his head, moving stiffly and slowly in a diagonal direction, from the recess, across the floor of the bedroom, passing my bed at the foot, and entering the lumber-closet at the left. He had something under his arm; his head hung a little at one side; and, merciful God! when I saw his face....'"<br> There's nothing like a good ghost story. And in <em>Victorian Ghost Stories</em>, Michael Cox and R.A. Gilbert bring together thirty-five well wrought tales of haunted houses, vengeful spirits, spectral warnings, invisible antagonists, and motiveless malignity from beyond the grave. The Victorians excelled at the ghost story, it was as much a part of their literary culture as the realistic novel, and it was practiced by almost all the great writers of the age. Cox and Gilbert here provide samples from Charles Dickens, Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry James, and Wilkie Collins, as well as such classic ghost-story specialists as M.R. James and J.S. Le Fanu (whose "Account of Some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street," considered one of the best haunted-house story ever written, is excerpted above), plus one or two genuine rarities for the supernatural fiction enthusiast to savor. The editors also reveal the key role played by women in the growth of the genre, including stories by Elizabeth Gaskell, Mrs. Craik, Mrs. Henry Wood, Amelia B. Edwards, Charlotte Riddell, and many others. Finally, they offer an informative introduction, detailed source notes, and an extensive survey of ghost-story collections from 1850 to 1910.<br> Traditional in its forms, but energetically inventive and infused with a relish of the supernatural, these classic ghost stories still retain their original power to unsettle and surprise. Every one is guaranteed to satisfy what Virginia Woolf called "that strange human craving for the pleasure of feeling afraid."</p><p><br><em>About the Editors:</em><br><strong>Michael Cox</strong> and <strong>R.A. Gilbert</strong> also edited the highly successful <em>Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories</em>.<br>Following up The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories , Cox and Gilbert here suggest that "ghost stories were something at which the Victorians excelled," pointing out that the stories reflect the insecurities hidden in an outwardly ordered and confident society. They note further that some of the writers who portrayed ladylike women encountering ghosts at their doors were female breadwinners churning out stories to keep the wolves from theirs. Such authors as Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Elizabeth Gaskell and Charlotte Riddell anchored ghostly events in the still waters of domestic detail, provoking an eerie contrast, while others, like J. S. Le Fanu and Henry James, used deliberately paced language to similar effect. The stories in this superior anthology, each one satisfying on its own, represent a great variety of period styles and spectres. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tracker</h2><p>Only thirteen, John must track a deer in the Minnesota woods for his family&#39;s winter meat, and in doing so finds himself drawn to the doe who leads him and hating his role as hunter.</p><p>Gary Paulsen is one of the most honored writers of contemporary literature for young readers, author of three Newbery Honor titles, <i>Dogsong</i>, <i>Hatchet</i>, and <i>The Winter Room</i>.

I chose the southeast option, the main concourse entrance, the one nearest the Metro and the bus station, because it was the busiest and the most popular with civilian workers, and I wanted plenty of civilian workers around, preferably a whole long unending stream of them, for insurance purposes, mostly against getting shot on sight. Arrests go bad all the time, sometimes accidentally, sometimes on purpose, so I wanted witnesses. I wanted independent eyeballs on me, at least at the beginning. I remember the date, of course. It was Tuesday, the eleventh of March, 1997, and it was the last day I walked into that place as a legal employee of the people who built it.<br><br>A long time ago.<br><br>The eleventh of March 1997 was also by chance exactly four and a half years before the world changed, on that other future Tuesday, and so like a lot of things in the old days the security at the main concourse entrance was serious without being hysterical. Not that I invited hysteria. Not from a distance. I was wearing my Class A uniform, all of it clean, pressed, polished, and spit-shined, all of it covered with thirteen years' worth of medal ribbons, badges, insignia, and citations. I was thirty-six years old, standing tall and walking ramrod straight, a totally squared away U.S. Army Military Police major in every respect, except that my hair was too long and I hadn't shaved for five days.<br><br>Back then Pentagon security was run by the Defense Protective Service, and from forty yards I saw ten of their guys in the lobby, which I thought was far too many, which made me wonder whether they were all theirs or whether some of them were actually ours, working undercover, waiting for me. Most of our skilled work is done by Warrant Officers, and they do a lot of it by pretending to be someone else. They impersonate colonels and generals and enlisted men, and anyone else they need to, and they're good at it. All in a day's work for them to throw on DPS uniforms and wait for their target. From thirty yards I didn't recognize any of them, but then, the army is a very big institution, and they would have chosen men I had never met before.<br><br>I walked on, part of a broad wash of people heading across the concourse to the doors, some men and women in uniform, either Class As like my own or the old woodland-pattern BDUs we had back then, and some men and women obviously military but out of uniform, in suits or work clothes, and some obvious civilians, some of each category carrying bags or briefcases or packages, all of each category slowing and sidestepping and shuffling as the broad wash of people narrowed to a tight arrowhead and then narrowed further still to lonely single file or collegial two-by-two, as folks got ready to stream inside. I lined up with them, on my own, single file, behind a woman with pale unworn hands and ahead of a guy in a suit that had gone shiny at the elbows. Civilians, both of them, desk workers, probably analysts of some kind, which was exactly what I wanted. Independent eyeballs. It was close to noon. There was sun in the sky and the March air had a little warmth in it. Spring, in Virginia. Across the river the cherry trees were about to wake up. The famous blossom was about to break out. All over the innocent nation airline tickets and SLR cameras lay on hall tables, ready for sightseeing trips to the capital.<br><br>I waited in line. Way ahead of me the DPS guys were doing what security guys do. Four of them were occupied with specific tasks, two manning an inquiry counter and two checking official badge holders and then waving them through an open turnstile. Two were standing directly behind the glass inside the doors, looking out, heads high, eyes front, scanning the approaching crowd. Four were hanging back in the shadows behind the turnstiles, just clumped together, shooting the shit. All ten were armed.<br><br>It was the four behind the turnstiles that worried me. No question that back in 1997 the Department of Defense was seriously puffed up and overmanned in relation to the threats we faced then, but even so it was unusual to see four on-duty guys with absolutely nothing to do. Most commands at least made their surplus personnel look busy. But these four had no obvious role. I stretched up tall and peered ahead and tried to get a look at their shoes. You can learn a lot from shoes. Undercover disguises often don't get that far, especially in a uniformed environment. The DPS was basically a beat cop role, so to the extent that a choice was available, DPS guys would go for cop shoes, big comfortable things appropriate for walking and standing all day. Undercover MP Warrant Officers might use their own shoes, which would be subtly different.<br><br>But I couldn't see their shoes. It was too dark inside, and too far away.<br><br>The line shuffled along, at a decent pre-9/11 clip. No sullen impatience, no frustration, no fear. Just old-style routine. The woman in front of me was wearing perfume. I could smell it coming off the nape of her neck. I liked it. The two guys behind the glass noticed me about ten yards out. Their gaze moved off the woman and onto me. It rested on me a beat longer than it needed to, and then it moved on to the guy behind.<br><br>Then it came back. Both men looked me over quite openly, up and down, side to side, four or five seconds, and then I shuffled forward and their attention moved behind me again. They didn't say anything to each other. Didn't say anything to anyone else, either. No warnings, no alerts. Two possible interpretations. One, best case, I was just a guy they hadn't seen before. Or maybe I stood out because I was bigger and taller than anyone within a hundred yards. Or because I was wearing a major's gold oak leaves and ribbons for some heavy-duty medals, including a Silver Star, like a real poster boy, but because of the hair and the beard I also looked like a real caveman, which visual dissonance might have been enough reason for the long second glance, just purely out of interest. Sentry duty can be boring, and unusual sights are always welcome.<br><br>Or two, worst case, they were merely confirming to themselves that some expected event had indeed happened, and that all was going according to plan. Like they had prepared and studied photographs and were saying to themselves: OK, he's here, right on time, so now we just wait two more minutes until he steps inside, and then we take him down.<br><br>Because I was expected, and I was right on time. I had a twelve o'clock appointment and matters to discuss with a particular colonel in a third-floor office in the C ring, and I was certain I would never get there. To walk head-on into a hard arrest was a pretty blunt tactic, but sometimes if you want to know for sure whether the stove is hot, the only way to find out is to touch it.<br><br>The guy ahead of the woman ahead of me stepped inside the doors and held up a badge that was attached to his neck by a lanyard. He was waved onward. The woman in front of me moved and then stopped short, because right at that moment the two DPS watchers chose to come out from behind the glass. The woman paused in place and let them squeeze out in front of her, against the pressing flow. Then she resumed her progress and stepped inside, and the two guys stopped and stood exactly where she had been, three feet in front of me, but facing in the opposite direction, toward me, not away from me.<br><br>They were blocking the door. They were looking right at me. I was pretty sure they were genuine DPS personnel. They were wearing cop shoes, and their uniforms had eased and stretched and molded themselves to their individual physiques over a long period of time. These were not disguises, snatched from a locker and put on for the first time that morning. I looked beyond the two guys, inside, at their four partners who were doing nothing, and I tried to judge the fit of their clothes, by way of comparison. It was hard to tell.<br><br>In front of me the guy on my right said, "Sir, may we help you?"<br><br>I asked, "With what?"<br><br>"Where are you headed today?"<br><br>"Do I need to tell you that?"<br><br>"No sir, absolutely not," the guy said. "But we could speed you along a little, if you like."<br><br>Probably via an inconspicuous door into a small locked room, I thought. I figured they had civilian witnesses on their mind too, the same way I did. I said, "I'm happy to wait my turn. I'm almost there, anyway."<br><br>The two guys said nothing in reply to that. Stalemate. Amateur hour. To try to start the arrest outside was dumb. I could push and shove and turn and run and be lost in the crowd in the blink of an eye. And they wouldn't shoot. Not outside. There were too many people on the concourse. Too much collateral damage. This was 1997, remember. March eleventh. Four and a half years before the new rules. Much better to wait until I was inside the lobby. The two stooges could close the doors behind me and form up shoulder to shoulder in front of them while I was getting the bad news at the desk. At that point theoretically I could turn back and fight my way past them again, but it would take me a second or two, and in that second or two the four guys with nothing to do could shoot me in the back about a thousand times.<br><br>And if I charged forward they could shoot me in the front. And where would I go anyway? To escape into the Pentagon was no kind of a good idea. The world's largest office building. Thirty thousand people. Five floors. Two basements. Seventeen miles of corridors. There are ten radial hallways between the rings, and they say a person can make it between any two random points inside a maximum seven minutes, which was presumably calculated with reference to the army's official quick- march pace of four miles an hour, which meant if I was running hard I could be anywhere within about three minutes. But where? I could find a broom closet and steal bag lunches and hold out a day or two, but that would be all. Or I could take hostages and try to argue my case, but I had never seen that kind of thing succeed.<br><br>So I waited.<br><br>The DPS guy in front of me on my right said, "Sir, you be sure and have a nice day now," and then he moved past me, and his partner moved past me on my other side, both of them just strolling slow, two guys happy to be out in the air, patrolling, varying their viewpoint. Maybe not so dumb after all. They were doing their jobs and following their plan. They had tried to decoy me into a small locked room, but they had failed, no harm, no foul, so now they were turning the page straight to plan B. They would wait until I was inside and the doors were closed, and then they would jump into crowd control mode, dispersing the incoming people, keeping them safe in case shots had to be fired inside. I assumed the lobby glass was supposed to be bulletproof, but the smart money never bets on the DoD having gotten exactly what it paid for.<br><br>The door was right in front of me. It was open. I took a breath and stepped into the lobby. Sometimes if you want to know for sure whether the stove is hot, the only way to find out is to touch it.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>The woman with the perfume and the pale hands was already deep into the corridor beyond the open turnstile. She had been waved through. Straight ahead of me was the two-man inquiry desk. To my left were the two guys checking badges. The open turnstile was between their hips. The four spare guys were still doing nothing beyond it. They were still clustered together, quiet and watchful, like an independent team. I still couldn't see their shoes.<br><br>I took another breath and stepped up to the counter.<br><br>Like a lamb to the slaughter.<br><br>The desk guy on the left looked at me and said, "Yes, sir." Fatigue and resignation in his voice. A response, not a question, as if I had already spoken. He looked young and reasonably smart. Genuine DPS, presumably. MP Warrant Officers are quick studies, but they wouldn't be running a Pentagon inquiry desk, however deeply under they were supposed to be.<br><br>The desk guy looked at me again, expectantly, and I said, "I have a twelve o'clock appointment."<br><br>"Who with?"<br><br>"Colonel Frazer," I said.<br><br>The guy made out like he didn't recognize the name. The world's largest office building. Thirty thousand people. He leafed through a book the size of a telephone directory and asked, "Would that be Colonel John James Frazer? Senate Liaison?"<br><br>I said, "Yes."<br><br>Or: Guilty as charged.<br><br>Way to my left the four spare guys were watching me. But not moving. Yet.<br><br>The guy at the desk didn't ask my name. Partly because he had been briefed, presumably, and shown photographs, and partly because my Class A uniform included my name on a nameplate, worn as per regulations on my right breast pocket flap, exactly centered, its upper edge exactly a quarter of an inch below the top seam.<br><br>Seven letters: REACHER.<br><br>Or, eleven letters: Arrest me now.<br><br>The guy at the inquiry desk said, "Colonel John James Frazer is in 3C315. You know how to get there?"<br><br>I said, "Yes." Third floor, C ring, nearest to radial corridor number three, bay number fifteen. The Pentagon's version of map coordinates, which it needed, given that it covered twenty-nine whole acres of floor space.<br><br>The guy said, "Sir, you have a great day," and his guileless gaze moved past my shoulder to the next in line. I stood still for a moment. They were tying it up with a bow. They were making it perfect. The general common law test for criminal culpability is expressed by the Latin actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, which means, roughly, doing things won't necessarily get you in trouble unless you actually mean to do them. Action plus intention is the standard. They were waiting for me to prove my intention. They were waiting for me to step through the turnstile and into the labyrinth. Which explained why the four spare guys were on their side of the gate, not mine. Crossing the line would make it real. Maybe there were jurisdiction issues. Maybe lawyers had been consulted. Frazer wanted my ass gone for sure, but he wanted his own ass covered just as much.<br><br>I took another breath and crossed the line and made it real. I walked between the two badge checkers and squeezed between the cold alloy flanks of the turnstile. The bar was retracted. There was nothing to hit with my thighs. I stepped out on the far side and paused. The four spare guys were on my right. I looked at their shoes. Army regulations are surprisingly vague about shoes. Plain black lace-up oxfords or close equivalents, conservative, no designs on them, minimum of three pairs of eyelets, closed toe, maximum two-inch heel. That's all the fine print says. The four guys on my right were all in compliance, but they weren't wearing cop shoes. Not like the two guys outside. They were sporting four variations on the same classic theme. High shines, tight laces, a little creasing and wear here and there. Maybe they were genuine DPS. Maybe they weren't. No way of telling. Not right then.<br><br>I was looking at them, and they were looking at me, but no one spoke. I looped around them and headed deeper into the building. I used the E ring counterclockwise and turned left at the first radial hallway.</p><h2>Captain&#39;s Log: William Shatner&#39;s Personal Account of the Making of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</h2><p>Chronicles William Shatner&#39;s starring role in the movie and includes photographs of the entire film process</p><p></p><h2>Melanie&#39;s Double Jinx (Thoroughbred Series #69)</h2><p><p> This 13 year old equestrian series is still running strong as it publishes it's 69th title! </p><p> Melanie and Image are back at Whitebrook after Brad Townsend's mysterious turn&#x2013;around, abruptly letting her take the filly away from Townsend Acres.

Spanning wars, the pioneering days, the fight for suffrage, the Depression, the era of Rosie the Riveter, the civil rights movement, and the feminist rebellion of the 1970s, this book describes the way women's lives were altered by dress fashions, medical advances, rules of hygiene, social theories about sex and courtship, and the ever-changing attitudes toward education, work, and politics. While keeping her eye on the big picture, Gail Collins still notes that corsets and uncomfortable shoes mattered a lot too.</p></p><p>Well researched and well written, <i>America's Women: 400 Years of Dolls, Drudges, Helpmates, and Heroines</i> is a powerful and important book. Starting with Pocahontas and Eleanor Dare (the first female colonist), this lively and fascinating history records the changes in American women's lives and the transformations in American society from the 1580s through the 2000s.<p> A history of the oft-marginalized sex must often draw from diaries and journals, which were disproportionally written by whites; as a result, African-American and Native American women are not as well represented as white in the earlier chapters of <i>America's Women</i>. However, Gail Collins writes about women of many races and ethnicities, and in fact provides more information about Native Americans, African-Americans, and Chinese, Jewish, and Italian immigrants than some general U.S. history books. She writes about rich and poor, young and old, urban and rural, slave and slave-owner, athlete and aviatrix, president's wife and presidential candidate--and, of course, men and women. And some of these women--from the justly famous, like Clara Barton and Harriet Tubman, to the undeservedly obscure, like Elizabeth Eckford and Senator Margaret Chase Smith--will not only make any woman proud to be a woman, they will make any American proud to be American.</p><p> An editor at the <i>New York Times</i>, Gail Collins has also written <i>Scorpion Tongues: Gossip, Celebrity, and American Politics</i> and, with Dan Collins, <i>The Millennium Book</i>. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p>Gail Collins, a columnist for the <em>New York Times</em>, was the the first woman ever to serve as editorial page editor for the paper.

She lives in a home not unlike the average home in a neighborhood that is, more or less, typically suburban. What sets her apart from the rest of us is that she thinks more deeply--and in more eloquent detail--about food. In sharing her ponderings, she sets a delightful example for those of us who seek the healthiest, most pleasurable lifestyle within an environment determined to propel us in the opposite direction. Joan is a suburbanite with a green thumb, with a feisty, defiant spirit and a relentlessly positive outlook.</p><p>At the heart of <em>This Organic Life</em> is the premise that locally grown food eaten in season makes sense economically, ecologically, and gastronomically. Transporting produce to New York from California--not to mention Central and South America, Australia, or Europe--consumes more energy in transit than it yields in calories. (It costs 435 fossil fuel calories to fly a 5-calorie strawberry from California to New York.) Add in the deleterious effects of agribusiness, such as the endless cycle of pesticide, herbicide, and chemical fertilizers; the loss of topsoil from erosion of over-tilled croplands; depleted aquifers and soil salinization from over-irrigation; and the arguments in favor of "this organic life" become overwhelmingly convincing.</p><p>Joan's story is funny and fiery as she points out the absurdities we have unthinkingly come to accept. You won't find an electric can opener in this woman's house. In fact, you probably won't find many cans, as Joan has discovered ways to nourish herself, literally and spiritually, from her own backyard. If you are looking for a tale of courage and independence in a setting that is entirely familiar, read her story.</p></p><p>A highly acclaimed nutritionist whose work has been published in Country Journal and Annals of Earth, Joan Dye Gussow is living testimony that eating well year-round from an average-sized lot in the suburbs of Piermont, New York, is both possible and desirable. To live this civilized version of &#34;the good life&#34; involves no sacrifice of variety or taste, and only enhances life&#39;s sensual pleasures and one&#39;s mental outlook.<p><em><strong>Library Journal-</strong></em><br><br>Two decades ago, when nutritionist Gussow was giving fiery speeches about the importance of eating locally and seasonally, she realized that it was time to put her convictions into practice. In this combination memoir, polemic, and gardening manual, she discusses the joys and challenges of growing organic produce in her own New York garden. Initially, Gussow had planned to write about her misadventures in buying a 150-year-old house on a Hudson River floodplain. That story was incorporated into this book, but many of the boring remodeling details should have been omitted. Interesting points include a description of establishing her new garden, tips on making compost and on growing fruits and vegetables successfully in a northern climate, and various recipes using the garden bounty. Throughout, Gussow stresses the need to live responsibly "in a society where thoughtless consumption is the norm." Her constant reminders that industrial agriculture produces tasteless, environmentally destructive food well intentioned though they may be start sounding like a litany after a while. Yet, despite its flaws and self-righteous tone, this work offers encouragement to urban and suburban gardeners who want to grow at least some of their own produce. A suitable addition to gardening collections in public libraries.</p> (Ilse Heidmann, San Marcos, TX)<br><br><p>"I love the 'sustainable hedonism' term that has been applied to Joan.

But Jacob let the light explore further, over the bearded, dirt-caked face, the gruesome clothes, which at first sight simply looked like poorly tanned leather, and on to the gross hands with which the Tailor plied his bloody trade. The fingers on his left hand ended in broad blades, each as long as a dagger. The blades on the right were just as long and lethal, though these were slender and pointed, like giant sewing needles. Both hands were missing a finger&#x2014;obviously other victims had tried to defend their skinds&#x2014;though the Tailor did not seem to miss them much.

On a search for the unique and original, he meets Aurelio Montes, the Chilean winemaker who planted syrah vines on a rocky, south-facing hill in order to "steal the wild complexity of the mountain's soul." In Spain, he learns of the white chalky soil called albariza that produces the sherry of the Jerez region. In California, the author describes crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, driving up into Marin County, and meeting enthusiastic winemakers whose vineyards sit precariously on the San Andreas fault. As the journey continues on through Burgundy, Champagne, and Sicily, Steadman brings the landscape and its people to life with pictures and prose. <br></p><p>RALPH STEADMAN has illustrated many books, including Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the fiftieth-anniversary edition of George Orwell's Animal Farm. He is the author of The Grapes of Ralph (for which he won a Glenfiddich Food &amp; Drink Award), Still Life with Bottle, The Book of Jones, and Gonzo. He lives in England. <br>CHILE<br><br>LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LAND<br><br>Where to begin a new volume, after my first journey into wine territory down among the red men was not so difficult after all?<br><br>My wife, Anna, and I were invited to New York in January 2002 to the launch of Montes Folly, the "wild dream" wine of Chilean winemakers Douglas Murray and Aurelio Montes-a wine with which they have taunted the gods and defied the wisdom of the experts.<br><br> "It'll never work," the experts said. "The grapes will explode!"<br><br> "Good!" I thought. "Only an artist would think like that!"<br>At the launch, Aurelio, who pilots his own light aircraft, demonstrated what his natural winemaker's eye could only see from up in the sky. Through a series of color slides, he described the trials and tribulations that beset two wild spirits with a crazy dream. It was important to move half a mountain to realize it. I was proud to be asked to provide the artwork for the label-an angel to watch over their baby.<br><br> Being a romantic and a lifetime supporter of the maverick tradition in all fields of human activity, it seemed so natural, so organic, to establish the landscape of this new book where my last book about wine, The Grapes of Ralph, left off-in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Such a strange and terrible place, but a link nevertheless to the land of Untrodden Grapes where I can put down roots and begin again.<br><br> Edward Abbey, the author of Desert Solitaire, wrote: "Enter at your own risk. Carry water. Avoid the noonday sun. Try to ignore the vultures and pray frequently." That is good advice to anyone, let alone to committed lovers of good wine. There are vultures everywhere-in deserts and vineyards, too-but there is also more rich life there than anyone dreams.<br><br> If you are a dreamer like Douglas Murray or Aurelio Montes, then you can be the Little Prince of Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry who believed that "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye."<br><br> Perhaps the perspective gained by pilots such as Saint-Exup�ry and Aurelio Montes encourages a loftier vision. You are flying over the very place where your dream lies hidden when, in an instant, it is your heart that realizes that what you have flown over so many times before is where you want to be. Or, as the Little Prince explains, "What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well." And, "Pure logic is the ruin of the spirit."<br><br> Douglas and Aurelio had originally found their desert dream in 1972 on the sharp, south-facing slopes of the Apalta area of the Colchagua Valley. They decided, quite illogically, to clear the slopes of boulders and plant Syrah vines and thus steal the wild complexity of the mountain's soul.<br>Imagine the mountain knowing that you planned such a scheme. It might rise up and burst open like a volcano, pouring down rocks, lava, and mayhem onto your puny attempt to plunder its riches. In business terms, this mad scheme made Douglas Murray clutch his head with trembling hands and tap the brain of Alfredo Vidaurre, the third, inspired partner of this trinity, a Shakespearean accountant no less, who balances their books like poetry and tempers their raw animal enthusiasm with a financial whip. Though I must, just for the record, say that Alfredo, a decent and reasonable man, compulsively makes strange and provocative duck noises when he enters a room. I have been there on many occasions. I have heard them. <br><br> The vines would simply burn up in the direct heat of the midday sun. But Aurelio pacified Douglas with an explanation of why his agricultural scheme would work: his was a plan of extremes and, in fact, the very hub of the reason why the vines would survive-not merely survive but thrive-extracting the very complexity of the mountain and its weather and imbuing their bounty with the dramatic characteristics possessed by all great mountain ranges. Faced with such a deep, resonant idea, Douglas could only embrace it with all the passion he has for deserts.<br><br> For half the day the southern face of the mountain is shadowed and cool-even cold-but in early afternoon the sun is blisteringly hot. The slopes behind the vines, still cool, are shaded by the vines and create conflicting microclimates throughout the rows. Air turbulence is also a factor, as Aurelio knew from flying; vortices of hot and cold currents sweep through the vines throughout the day, providing massive ventilation beneath the leaves and never allowing pockets of stillness for mildew to flourish. The vines grow like wild children, adopting the tannic edge of life in such a restless place and absorbing the spirit of nature in all its untamed grandeur.<br><br> Together, Douglas and Aurelio set about the massive work of many years. They haven't tamed the mountain. They never could and never would want to. They are working and flying in the vortices of nature's gargantuan laboratory-inside a crescent-shaped cranny at over 45 degrees of slope broiling in over 45 degrees Celsius-nestled in the coastal range of the Colchagua Valley.<br><br> Douglas Murray says that the grapes are harvested by acrobats and, though the yields have been low, the power in the juice rewards the pair with such complex eloquence-the mountain's tears-that one day the mountain will surely offer up its heart.<br><br>Copyright � 2005 by Ralph Steadman<br><br>All rights reserved.

In addition to traditional material on rhetoric and background, this social-scientific commentary brings to the fore necessary, significant and enlightening ways of understanding the social role of Paul and his social dynamics with the churches he founded. In this it is unique; it is the only comprehensive social-science reading of Paul. The reading scenarios at the end are themselves worth the price of this book." &#x2014; Jerome Neyrey, University of Notre Dame <p>"This is not the typical introspective, individualistic Paul of Western theology.

Really, I think of myself as the one and only Tudor princess, for my sister Mary is too young to do more than be brought in by her nurse at suppertime, and taken out again. I make sure Mary&#x2019;s nursemaids are quite clear that she is to be shown to our new sister-in-law, and then go. There is no profit in letting her sit up at the table, or gorge on crystallized plums. Rich things make her sick and if she gets tired she will bawl. She is only five years old, far too young for state occasions. Unlike me; I am all but twelve. I have to play my part in the wedding; it would not be complete without me. My lady grandmother, the king&#x2019;s mother, said so herself.<br> <br>Then she said something that I couldn&#x2019;t quite hear, but I know that the Scots lords will be watching me to see if I look strong and grown-up enough to be married at once. I am sure I am. Everyone says that I am a bonny girl, stocky as a Welsh pony, healthy as a milkmaid, fair, like my younger brother Harry, with big blue eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be next,&#x201d; she says to me with a smile. &#x201c;They say that one wedding begets another.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t have to travel as far as Princess Katherine,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come home on visits.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You will.&#x201d; My lady grandmother&#x2019;s promise makes it a certainty. &#x201c;You are marrying our neighbor, and you will make him our good friend and ally.&#x201d;<br> <br>Princess Katherine had to come all the way from Spain, miles and miles away. Since we are quarreling with France, she had to come by sea, and there were terrible storms and she was nearly wrecked. When I go to Scotland to marry the king, it will be a great procession from Westminster to Edinburgh of nearly four hundred miles. I shan&#x2019;t go by sea, I won&#x2019;t arrive sick and sopping wet, and I will come and go from my new home to London whenever I like. But Princess Katherine will never see her home again. They say she was crying when she first met my brother. I think that is ridiculous. And babyish as Mary.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall I dance at the wedding?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;You and Harry shall dance together,&#x201d; my lady grandmother rules. &#x201c;After the Spanish princess and her ladies have shown us a Spanish dance. You can show her what an English princess can do.&#x201d; She smiles slyly. &#x201c;We shall see who is best.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me,&#x201d; I pray. Out loud I say: &#x201c;A basse danse?&#x201d; It is a slow grand grown-up dance which I do very well, actually more walking than dancing.<br> <br>&#x201c;A galliard.&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t argue; nobody argues with my lady grandmother. She decides what happens in every royal household, in every palace and castle; my lady mother the queen just agrees.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to rehearse,&#x201d; I say. I can make Harry practice by promising him that everyone will be watching. He loves to be the center of attention and is always winning races and competing at archery and doing tricks on his pony. He is as tall as me, though he is only ten years old, so we look well together if he doesn&#x2019;t play the fool. I want to show the Spanish princess that I am just as good as the daughter of Castile and Aragon. My mother and father are a Plantagenet and a Tudor. Those are grand enough names for anyone. Katherine needn&#x2019;t think that we are grateful for her coming. I, for one, don&#x2019;t particularly want another princess at court.<br> <br><br> <br>It is my lady mother who insists that Katherine visit us at Baynard&#x2019;s Castle before the wedding, and she is accompanied by her own court, who have come all the way from Spain&#x2014;at our expense, as my father remarks. They enter through the double doors like an invading army, their clothes, their speech, their headdresses completely unlike ours and, at the center of it all, beautifully gowned, is the girl that they call the &#x201c;infanta.&#x201d; This too is ridiculous, as she is fifteen and a princess, and I think that they are calling her &#x201c;baby.&#x201d; I glance across at Harry to see if he will giggle if I make a face and say &#x201c;ba-aby,&#x201d; which is how we tease Mary, but he is not looking at me. He is looking at her with goggle-eyes, as if he is seeing a new horse, or a piece of Italian armor, or something that he has set his heart on. I see his expression, and I realize that he is trying to fall in love with her, like a knight with a damsel in a story. Harry loves stories and ballads about impossible ladies in towers, or tied to rocks, or lost in woods, and somehow Katherine impressed him when he met her before her entry into London. Perhaps it was her ornate veiled litter, perhaps it was her learning, for she speaks three languages. I am so annoyed&#x2014;I wish he was close enough for me to pinch him. This is exactly why no one younger than me should play a part in royal occasions.<br> <br>She is not particularly beautiful. She is three years older than me but I am as tall as her. She has light brown hair with a copper tinge to it, only a little darker than mine. This is, of course, irritating: who wants to be compared to a sister-in-law? But I can hardly see it, for she wears a high headpiece and a thick concealing veil. She has blue eyes like mine too, but very fair eyebrows and lashes; obviously, she&#x2019;s not allowed to color them in like I do. She has pale creamy skin, which I suppose is admirable. She is tiny: tiny waist pinched in by tight lacing so she can hardly breathe, tiny feet with the most ridiculous shoes I have ever seen, gold-embroidered toes and gold laces. I don&#x2019;t think that my lady grandmother would let me wear gold laces. It would be vanity and worldly show. I am sure that the Spanish are very worldly. I am sure that she is.<br> <br>I make certain that my thoughts don&#x2019;t show on my face as I examine her. I think she is lucky to come here, lucky to be chosen by my father to marry my elder brother Arthur, lucky to have a sister-in-law like me, a mother-in-law like my mother and&#x2014;more than anything else&#x2014;a grandmother-in-law like Lady Margaret Beaufort, who will make very sure that Katherine does not exceed her place which has been appointed by God.<br> <br>She curtseys and kisses my lady mother and, after her, my lady grandmother. This is how it should be; but she will soon learn that she had better please my lady grandmother before anybody. Then my lady mother nods to me and I step forward, and the Spanish princess and I curtsey together at the same time, to exactly the same depth, and she steps forward and we kiss on one cheek and then the other. Her cheeks are warm and I see that she is blushing, her eyes filling with tears as if she is missing her real sisters. I show her my stern look, just like my father when someone is asking him for money. I am not going to fall in love with her for her blue eyes and pretty ways. She need not imagine she is going to come into our English court and make us look fat and stupid.<br> <br>She is not at all rebuffed; she looks right back at me. Born and raised in a competitive court with three sisters, she understands rivalry. Worse, she looks at me as if she finds my stern look to be not at all chilling, perhaps even a little comical. That is when I know that this is not a young woman like my ladies-in-waiting who has to be pleasant to me whatever I do, or like Mary, who has to do whatever I say. This young woman is an equal, she will consider me, she might even be critical. I say in French: &#x201c;You are welcome to England,&#x201d; and she replies in stilted English: &#x201c;I am pleased to greet my sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>My lady mother lays herself out to be kind to this, her first, daughter-in-law. They talk together in Latin and I cannot follow what they are saying so I sit beside my mother and look at Katherine&#x2019;s shoes with the gold laces. My mother calls for music, and Harry and I start a round, an English country song. We are very tuneful and the court takes up the chorus and it goes round and round until people start to giggle and lose their places. But Katherine does not laugh. She looks as if she is never silly and merry like Harry and me. She is overly formal, of course, being Spanish. But I note how she sits&#x2014;very still, and with her hands folded in her lap as if she were sitting for a portrait&#x2014;and I think: actually, that looks rather queenly. I think I will learn to sit like that.<br> <br>My sister Mary is brought in to make her curtsey, and Katherine makes herself ridiculous by going down on her knees so their faces are level and she can hear her childish whisper. Of course Mary cannot understand a word of either Latin or Spanish, but she puts her arms around Katherine&#x2019;s neck and kisses her and calls her &#x201c;thithter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am your sister,&#x201d; I correct her, giving her little hand a firm tug. &#x201c;This lady is your sister-in-law. Can you say sister-in-law?&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course, she can&#x2019;t. She lisps, and everyone laughs again and says how charming, and I say: &#x201c;Lady Mother, shouldn&#x2019;t Mary be in bed?&#x201d; Then everyone realizes how late it is and we all go out with bobbing torches to see Katherine leave, as if she were a queen crowned and not merely the youngest daughter of the King and Queen of Spain, and very lucky to marry into our family: the Tudors.<br> <br>She kisses everyone good night and when it is my turn, she puts her warm cheek to mine and says: &#x201c;Good night, Sister&#x201d; in that stupid accent, in her patronizing way. She draws back and sees my cross face and she gives a little ripple of laughter. &#x201c;Oho!&#x201d; she says, and pats my cheek as if my bad temper does not trouble her. This is a real princess, as naturally royal as my mother; this is the girl who will be Queen of England; and so I don&#x2019;t resent the pat, more like a caress. I find that I like her and dislike her, all together, all at once.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you will be kind to Katherine,&#x201d; my mother says to me as we come out of her private chapel after Prime the next morning.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not if she thinks she&#x2019;s going to come here and lord it over all of us,&#x201d; I say briskly. &#x201c;Not if she thinks she is going to act as if she is doing us a favor. Did you see her shoelaces?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother laughs with genuine amusement. &#x201c;No, Margaret. I did not see her shoelaces, nor did I ask you for your opinion of her. I told you of my hope: that you will be kind to her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I say, looking down at my missal with the jeweled cover. &#x201c;I hope that I am gracious to everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She is far from her home and accustomed to a big family,&#x201d; my mother says. &#x201c;She will certainly need a friend, and you might enjoy the company of an older girl. I had lots of sisters at home when I was growing up, and I value them, more and more every year. You too might find that your women friends are your truest friends, your sisters are the keepers of your memories and hopes for the future.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She and Arthur will stay here?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;They will live with us?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother rests her hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;I wish they could stay; but your father thinks they should go to Arthur&#x2019;s principality and live at Ludlow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What does my lady grandmother think?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother gives a little shrug. That means it has been decided. &#x201c;She says the Prince of Wales must govern Wales.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll still have me at home.&#x201d; I put my hand over hers to keep her beside me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll still be here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I count on you,&#x201d; she says reassuringly.<br> <br><br> <br>I have only one moment alone with my brother Arthur before the wedding. He walks with me in the long gallery. Below, we can hear the musicians striking up another dance, and the buzz of people drinking and chattering and laughing. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to bow so low to her,&#x201d; I say abruptly. &#x201c;Her father and mother are new-come to their thrones just like our father. She has nothing to be so very proud of. They&#x2019;re no better than us. They&#x2019;re not an ancient line.&#x201d;<br> <br>He flushes. &#x201c;You think her proud?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Without reason.&#x201d; I heard my grandmother say exactly this to my lady mother so I know it is right.<br> <br>But Arthur argues. &#x201c;Her parents conquered Spain and took it back from the Moors. They are the greatest crusaders in the world. Her mother is a queen militant. They have extraordinary wealth and own half of the unmapped world. Some grounds for pride there, surely?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s that, I suppose,&#x201d; I say begrudgingly. &#x201c;But we are Tudors.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We are,&#x201d; he agrees with a little laugh. &#x201c;But that doesn&#x2019;t impress everyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course it does,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Especially now . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Neither of us says any more; we are both aware that there are many heirs to the English throne, dozens of Plantagenet boys, our mother&#x2019;s kinsmen, still living at our court, or run away to exile. Father has killed my mother&#x2019;s cousins in battles, and destroyed more than one pretender: he executed our cousin Edward two years ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think her proud?&#x201d; he challenges me. &#x201c;Has she been rude to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>I spread my hands in the gesture of surrender that my mother makes when she is told that my lady grandmother has overruled her. &#x201c;Oh, she doesn&#x2019;t bother to talk to me, she has no interest in a mere sister. She is too busy being charming, especially to Father. Anyway, she can hardly speak English.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she just shy? I know that I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would she be shy? She&#x2019;s going to be married, isn&#x2019;t she? She&#x2019;s going to be Queen of England, isn&#x2019;t she? She&#x2019;s going to be your wife. Why would she be anything but completely delighted with herself?&#x201d;<br> <br>Arthur laughs and hugs me. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you think that there is nothing better in the world but to be Queen of England?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I say simply. &#x201c;She should realize it and be grateful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you will be Queen of Scotland,&#x201d; he points out. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s grand too. You have that to look forward to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do, and I certainly won&#x2019;t ever be anxious and homesick or lonely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;King James will be a lucky man to have such a contented bride.&#x201d;<br> <br>That is the closest I get to warning him that Katherine of Aragon is looking down her long Spanish nose at us. But I nickname her Katherine of Arrogant and Mary hears me say it, since she is everywhere, always eavesdropping on her elders and betters. She catches it up, and it makes me laugh every time I hear her and see my mother&#x2019;s quick frown and quiet correction.<br> <br><br> <br>The wedding passes off very brilliantly, arranged by my lady grandmother, of course, to show the world just how wealthy and grand we are now. Father has spent a fortune on a week of jousting and celebration and feasting, the fountains flow with wine, they roast oxen in Smithfield Market, and the people tear up the wedding carpet so that they can all have a little piece of Tudor glory on their sideboards. This is my first chance to see a royal wedding and I inspect the bride from the top of her beautiful white lace headdress, which they call a mantilla, to the heels of her embroidered shoes.<br> <br>She looks pretty, I cannot deny that, but there is no cause for everyone to behave as if she is a miracle of beauty. Her long hair is the color of gold and brass, and falls around her shoulders nearly to her waist. She is as dainty as a little picture, which makes me feel awkward, as if my feet and hands are too big. It would be petty and a sin to think badly of her because of this, but I admit to myself that it will be better for everyone when she conceives a son and a Tudor heir, disappears into confinement for months, and comes out fat.<br> <br>As soon as the feast is over, the double doors at the end of the hall open and a great float comes in, pulled by dancers in Tudor green. It is a huge castle, beautifully decorated with eight ladies inside, the princ...</p><h2>Sky: Memoirs (European sources)</h2><p>Stated First American Edition, 1-10. Mylar protected dust jacket has small closed tear on bottom edge and is price clipped.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchHiding from the Gestapo in Aix-en-Provence, France, from 1940 to 1944, Swiss-born novelist and poet Cendrars pored over scholarly documents on the purported levitation of saints and prophets. A war correspondent before he resigned his post and went into seclusion, Cendrars (1887-1961) oscillates between engagement and escapism in this hypnotic autobiographical chronicle, a feverishly lyrical collage of reportage, exotic travel writing, existential adventure and "found texts" about levitating saints' lives and miracles. As a teenager Cendrars traversed Siberia with a jewelry merchant. Later he made a pilgrimage to a strange Brazilian doctor obsessed with Sarah Bernhardt, and sailed from Rio to Cherbourg with 67 marmosets and 250 tropical birds. He writes of his son Remy, an aviator killed in WW II, and recounts the exploits of Dadaist poet/boxer Arthur Cravan, nephew of Oscar Wilde and WW I deserter. Felicitously translated, this is a great, haunted meditation on death, love, war and spiritual ecstasy. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>An Occult Physiology: (CW 128)</h2><p>Given the upsurge of interest in complementary therapies and treatments, medical researchers are gradually being pressured to reassess and expand their knowledge of the structure and organization of the whole human body. Despite advances in modern technology, there are vast areas of human physiological activity that remain undetectable to conventional scientific observation. Those processes, according to Rudolf Steiner, are related to spiritual forces and beings. <br><br> In these revealing lectures, Steiner concentrates on the relationship between those forces and the human physical organs. In particular, he discusses the organs that make up our digestive and respiratory systems; the significance of &#x201c;warmth&#x201d; in the function of the blood and its effects on the I, or Ego; and the evolutionary process implicit in the formation of the spinal column and brain. He deals with all of this in a scientific way that will appeal equally to doctors and therapists, as well as students of Steiner&#x2019;s spiritual science. These talks&#x2015;long out of print&#x2015;are also remarkably accessible to the general reader.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Julie of the Wolves: Treasury (Julie of the Wolves, Julie, and Julie&#39;s Wolf Pack)</h2><p>To her small Eskimo village, she is known as Miyax; to her friend in San Francisco, she is Julie. When her life in the village becomes dangerous, Miyax runs away, only to find herself lost in the Alaskan wilderness. Without food and time running out, Miyax tries to survive by copying the ways of a pack of wolves. Accepted by their leader and befriended by a feisty pup named Kapu, she soon grows to love her new wolf family. Life in the wilderness is a struggle, but when she finds her way back to civilization, Miyax is torn between her old a new lives. Is she Miyax of the Eskimos -- or Julie of the wolves?</p><p>Miyax, like many adolescents, is torn. But unlike most, her choices may determine whether she lives or dies. At 13, an orphan, and unhappily married, Miyax runs away from her husband's parents' home, hoping to reach San Francisco and her pen pal. But she becomes lost in the vast Alaskan tundra, with no food, no shelter, and no idea which is the way to safety. Now, more than ever, she must look hard at who she really is. Is she Miyax, Eskimo girl of the old ways? Or is she Julie (her "gussak"-white people-name), the modernized teenager who must mock the traditional customs? And when a pack of wolves begins to accept her into their community, Miyax must learn to think like a wolf as well. If she trusts her Eskimo instincts, will she stand a chance of surviving? John Schoenherr's line drawings suggest rather than tell about the compelling experiences of a girl searching for answers in a bleak landscape that at first glance would seem to hold nothing.

Here is a world that is immediately recognizable--through a shot glass at three A.M. This is life with rough edges, in a novel that gives you the straight goods--point blank-- one cold, snowbound Christmas Eve in Kansas. One single night, defined in shadings of black and white, when everything changes. . . .<br><br>For most, the city is closing up. For a few outsiders, this night, Christmas Eve 1979, is just beginning. Charlie Arglist is a lawyer saying goodbye to Wichita by revisiting the landscape of his used up life: the cold stare of his angry ex-wife, the empty strip clubs and bars where loneliness turns a profit, the frozen glare of ex-lovers and cops long snuggled in his deep pockets. Club owner Renata, an elegant dish in a smoky dive, dreams of financial prosperity and holds a single frame of a stolen film that could help her achieve them. And there's Vic. He's got a reputation, a bad temper, and a secret worth half a million dollars. Not to mention a knack for bringing people together . . . for the last time. Before the night is over, the decisions they face and the choices they make will irrevocably alter the course of their lives--if they can live long enough to see Christmas Day sunrise.</p><p>For all that it involves organized crime, naked women, grumpy bouncers, a serious snowstorm, and a hero with a profound drinking pattern, <i>The Ice Harvest</i> is a quiet little book--noir-ish, certainly, but never to excess. As the novel traces Charlie Arglist's trail around his small Kansas hometown on Christmas Eve, 1979, the lawyer's literal footprints are clear enough, given the whopper of a blizzard that's descended, but his metaphorical path is far less obvious. He's killing time before leaving town, but where is he going? And why? <p> Scott Phillips' sketch of a crooked lawyer on the lam is amusingly ironic: though there's violence aplenty in the novel--including a morbidly comic finger-breaking scene starring Spencer, a philosophical bouncer at the Sweet Cage, one of the strip clubs Charlie oversees for Bill Gerard--this is <i>Waiting for Godot</i> rather than <i>Goodfellas</i>. Phillips masterfully sets up the reader's expectations for action and adventure, dropping cryptic hints about Charlie's past, present, and future, then gleefully keeps Charlie in a holding pattern, circling from one strip club to another, from bars to massage parlors to his former in-laws' house. </p><p> But when the world isn't scripted by Beckett, all waiting games must come to an end. Charlie's gamble--it would be cheating to tell you more than that it involves a little cocaine, a beautiful woman of indeterminate origin, a Christmas package full of cash, and an embarrassing photograph--pays off, and he heads out of town. How far does he get? Well, that's another story--and another opportunity for Phillips to show off the mordant humor that may brand him as the Cohen brothers' literary heir apparent. In his hands, Kansas doesn't seem far at all from <i>Fargo</i>. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>"[A] funny, craftily malevolent first novel, an ice-pick-sharp crime story that sustains its film noir energy all the way to an outrageous whammy of an ending."<br>-<i>The New York Times<br><br></i>"[An] astonishing debut novel from a writer who manages to put a funny, modernist spin on a piece of our noir past: Jim Thompson frosted with a blast of Jonathan (<i>Motherless Brooklyn</i>) Lethem."<br><i>-Chicago Tribune<br></i><br><i><br></i></p><h2>Survey Of Historic Costume: A History Of Western Dress</h2><p>This bestseller brings the authors&#39; analysis of Western dress up to date and adds a number of new features.

The Beatles in Their Generation</i> tells the extraordinary story of the rise of four scruffy boys from Liverpool to beings more adored, more influential -- and in many ways more troubled --than any in the history of popular entertainment. It is also a penetrating social history of our time, based on an incredible wealth of material -- eyewitness accounts, interviews, stories withheld from the press and public -- that was available exclusively to the author. </p><p> Rich in detail, anecdotes, and background, with 100 stunning photographs, <i>Shout!</i> takes us from the wild, often comical days at the beginning in Liverpool to the life and death of Stu Sutcliffe, the brilliant boy known as the "fifth Beatle"; from the psychedelic triumph of <i>Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> to the band's embrace of Indian music and spirituality; from the brilliantly unified sounds of <i>Abbey Road</i> to Paul's desperate attempts to form a final comeback concert. </p><p> Riveting, Enlightening, Heartbreaking, <i>Shout!</i> Is A True Epic.</p></p><p><b>Philip Norman</b> is a journalist and a novelist who in 1968 was assigned to cover the Beatles' own business utopia, Apple Corps, from the inside. He is the author of <i>Rave On: The Biography of Buddy Holly</i> and many other books.CHAPTER ONE: <b>"HE WAS THE ONE I'D WAITED FOR"</b> <p> John Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, during a brief respite in Nazi Germany's bombing of Liverpool. All summer, after tea, people would switch on their radios at low volume, listening, not to the muted dance music but to the sky outside their open back doors. When the music cut off, before the first siren went, you knew that the bombers were returning. </p><p> Liverpool paid a heavy price for its naval shipyards, and for the miles of docks where convoys stood making ready to brave the North Atlantic. The city was Britain's last loophole for overseas food supplies. Night after night, with geometric accuracy, explosions tore along the seaming of wharves and warehouses and black castle walls, and over the tramlines into streets of friendly red back-to-back houses, of pubs and missions and corner dairies with cowsheds behind. During the worst week so many ships lay sunk along the Mersey there was not a single berth free for incoming cargo. But on Lime Street the Empire theater carried on performances as usual. Sometimes the whole audience would crowd out into the foyer and look across the black acropolis of St. George's Hall to a sky flashing white, then dark again as more bombs pummeled the port and the river. </p><p> Mimi Stanley had always worried about her younger sister, Julia. She worried about her especially tonight with more Luftwaffe raids expected and Julia in labor in the Oxford Street maternity home. When news of the baby came by telephone Mimi set out on foot from the Stanley house on Newcastle Road. "I ran two miles. I couldn't stop thinking, 'It's a boy, it's a boy. He's the one I've waited for.' " </p><p> She held John in her arms twenty minutes after he was born. His second name, Julia said -- in honor of Britain's inspirational prime minister, Winston Churchill -- would be Winston. Just then a parachute-borne land mine fell directly outside the hospital. "But my sister stayed in bed," Mimi said, "and they put the baby under the bed. They wanted me to go into the basement, but I wouldn't. I ran all the way back to Newcastle Road to tell Father the news. 'Get under shelter,' the wardens were shouting. 'Oh, be quiet,' I told them. Father was there, and I said, 'It's a boy and he's beautiful, he's the best one of all.' Father looked up and said, 'Oh heck, he <i>would</i> be.' " </p><p> Mimi's and Julia's father was an official with the Glasgow and Liverpool Salvage Company. He was aboard the salvage tug that tried to raise the submarine <i>Thetis</i> from her deathbed in Liverpool Bay. He had five daughters and brought them up strictly, though he was often away from home salvaging ships. "We loved Father," Mimi said, "but we liked it when he went away to sea and we girls could kick over the traces a bit. If ever there was a boy I had my eye on, I used to pray at night, 'Please God, let no one be hurt but let there be a wreck.' " </p><p> Mimi was slender, brisk, and dark, with fine cheekbones like a Cherokee. Julia was slim, auburn-haired, more conventionally pretty. Both loved laughter, but Mimi insisted there should be sense in it. "Oh, Julia," she would endlessly plead, "be <i>serious."</i> Julia could never be serious about anything. </p><p> Her marriage to Freddy Lennon in 1938 had been the least serious act of her life. She met Freddy one day in Sefton Park, and commented on the silly hat he wore. To please her, Freddy sent it skimming into the lake. She started bringing him home, to her whole family's great dismay. He was only a ship's waiter, erratically employed; he preferred, in the nautical term for malingering, to "swallow the anchor." Julia married him on an impulse at Mount Pleasant Register Office, putting down her occupation as "cinema usherette" because she knew how it would annoy her father. "I'll never forget that day," Mimi said. "Julia came home, threw a piece of paper on the table and said, 'There, that's it. I've married him.' " </p><p> Within little more than a year, World War II had broken out, sending Freddy to sea on a succession of merchant ships and condemning Julia to a life of alternating grim boredom and terror in the Liverpool Blitz. Freddie was doing war work requiring as much courage and self-sacrifice as any other. But he also loved shipboard life, where he was always the star turn in amateur concerts, "blacking up" like Al Jolson or singing torrid ballads like "Begin the Beguine." </p><p> After John was born, in 1940, Freddie's spells of shore leave became increasingly more erratic. His longest absence was a bizarre eighteen-month odyssey that saw him variously arrested for deserting his ship in New York and stranded in B�ne, North Africa, while, back home in Liverpool, his family presumed him dead and payment of his wages to Julia was suspended. When eventually he arrived home, it was to find Julia pregnant by another man, a Welsh soldier stationed in Liverpool. The baby, a girl, baptized Victoria Elizabeth, was born in 1945, a few weeks after the war's end. Freddie was willing to forgive Julia, adopt Victoria, and bring her up alongside John. But Julia's family, fearing a public disgrace, insisted that the baby must be put out for adoption. </p><p> Though his marriage was clearly on the rocks, Freddie was unwilling to relinquish John. In April 1946, hearing that Julia had acquired a new man friend, he abducted John and fled with him to the seaside resort of Blackpool, planning vaguely for the two of them to emigrate to New Zealand. Before he could take the scheme further, however, Julia turned up in Blackpool and announced she was taking John home to Liverpool. The six-year-old was then faced with an agonizing choice: "Do you want to go with Mummy or Daddy?" He chose Julia. A crushed Freddie made no move to keep them from going off together. </p><p> All Julia's sisters lent a hand in caring for John. But one sister cared specially -- the one who, having no babies of her own, ran through the air raid to hold him. From the moment John could talk, he would say, "Where's Mimi? Where's Mimi's house?" </p><p> "Julia had met someone else, with whom she had a chance of happiness," Mimi said. "And no man wants another man's child. That's when I said I wanted to bring John to Menlove Avenue to live with George and me. I wouldn't even let him risk being hurt or feeling he was in the way. I made up my mind that I'd be the one to give him what every child has the right to -- a safe and happy home life." </p><p> The fires ceased falling on Liverpool. The city, though cratered like a Roman ruin, returned to its old, majestically confident commercial life. St. George's Hall, badly scarred, still stood within its columns, between equestrian statues of Victoria and Albert. Along the docks, the overhead railway remained intact, passing above the funnels and warehouses and branching masts, the horse-drawn wagons and clanking, shuffling "Green Goddess" Liverpool trams. Business resumed in the streets lined by statues and colonnades and Moorish arches and huge public clocks. At the Pier Head, that broad riverfront, congregations of trams drew up between the Mersey and its three gray waterside temples: the Cunard Company, the Docks and Harbour Board, and the Royal Liver Insurance Company. The "Liver building" was still there, its twin belfries soaring higher than the seagulls and crowned with the skittish stone silhouettes of the "Liver birds." </p><p> Liverpool was still business and banking and insurance -- and ships. From the southern headland, under rings of tall cranes, came the rhythmic clout of Cammell Laird's yard where they built the <i>Alabama,</i> the <i>Mauretania,</i> the <i>Ark Royal,</i> the Thetis. Across from Birkenhead, brisk river ferries crossed the path of ocean liners, warships, merchantmen, and the smaller fry of what was still Europe's busiest shipping pool. Ever and again, from a slipway on the broad river bend, some fresh ungarnished hull would slide backward, and ride there, free of drag chains, while tug whoops mingled with cheers from the bank. </p><p> Liverpool was docks and ships and as such indistinguishable in Britain's northern industrial fogs but for one additional, intermittent product: Liverpool was where music-hall comedians, such as Tommy Handley, Arthur Askey, and Robb Wilton, came from. Some elixir in a population mixed from Welsh and Irish, and also lascar and Chinese, and uttered in the strange glottal dialect that simultaneously seems to raise derisive eyebrows, had always possessed the power to make the rest of the country laugh. </p><p> Liverpool "comics" were always preferred by the London theatrical agents. But there was a proviso. It was better for them to lose their Liverpool accents, and omit all references to the city of their origin. No one in London cared about a place so far to the northwest, so gray and sooty and old-fashioned, and above all, so utterly without glamour as Liverpool. </p><p> Woolton, where John grew up, is a suburb six miles to the southeast, but further in spirit, from the Liverpool of docks and Chinatown and pub signs pasted round every street corner. From Lime Street you drive uphill, past the grand old Adelphi Hotel, past the smaller backstreet hotels with no pretense at grandeur, past the Baptist temples and Irish meeting halls and grassed-over bomb sites turned into eternal temporary parking lots, lapping against some isolated little waterworks or church. Eventually you come to a traffic circle known by the name of its smallest tributary, Penny Lane. Woolton lies beyond, in wide dual carriageways with grass verges and mock Tudor villas whose gardens adjoin parks, country clubs, and golf courses. </p><p> Woolton, in fact, is such a respectable, desirable, and featureless suburb as grows up close to any British industrial city. Until 1963, it had only one claim on history. A lord of the same name was Britain's wartime minister of food and inventor of the "Woolton Pie," which boasted total, if unappetizing, nourishment for only one old shilling a portion. </p><p> The country village that Woolton used to be is still distinguishable in narrow lanes winding up to its red sandstone parish church, St. Peter's.

John Rossendale, 28th Earl of Stowey, is a 30-ish semi-rebel who has escaped his nasty, impoverished family by bumming around the world in his sailboat Sunflower . He returns to England in time to receive a maternal death-bed curse and then, before he can get away again, is embroiled in a search for the "Stowey Van Gogh." Stolen years ago (John was a suspect), the lost family heirloom is lusted after by a mega-rich tycoon. To provide for his only nice sibling, the retarded Georgina, Rossendale agrees to help find the Van Gogh, which is being held for ransom, and to give it to the tycoon. Rossendale also succumbs to the charms of the tycoon's step-daughter (herself a contessa) and thinks about settling down. But first there's a mystery to solve and perils to face, culminating in a foggy duel in dangerous Channel waters.

This is an elegant, uncompromising affirmation of the extraordinary powers of poetic imagination from a poet whose poems have been hailed by J.D. McClatchy as "ways of thinking on paper."</p><p>New and classic essays by one of America's most distinguished contemporary poet-critics, <i>The Work of Poetry</i> surveys an extraordinary range of poets, from Dante to May Swenson, and George Meredith to Marianne Moore, as well as works from the Psalms to <i>A Child's Garden of Verses.</i>Cautionary words about poetry from an idiosyncratic and surprising critic and poet. Hollander, usually regarded as a conservative observer of things poetic, both lives up to his reputation and defies it willingly in this essay collection. The Yale professor (and Bollingen Prize and MacArthur fellowship winner) predictably decries, for example, the dominance of creative-writing programs in contemporary America, blaming them in part for the rise of underachieving free verse and for an oversupply of poets who may not deserve the name. ``Free verse . . . is very easy to write if you don't know how,'' he comments, convinced that many self-styled poets don't. ``Good poets know how,'' he notes--as if we couldn't figure that out for ourselves. At his best, Hollander abandons contempt and complaint in favor of real eloquence and mindfulness. For instance, his essays about poets May Swenson and Elizabeth Bishop are models of insight and stylistic clarity and tact. Anyone interested in poetry or criticism must read them. Hollander on Swenson: ``Let words play with each other and they will do the imagination's work. As she herself observed in the preface to a selection of her poems that she'd made for children and that highlights the matter of puzzle and riddle in all poetry: `Notice how a poet's games are called his ``works''--and how the ``work'' you do to solve a poem is really play. . . .' Very, very good poetry does indeed make temporary poets of its readers, just as the inventiveness of poetry is itself so often a kind of interpretation.'' Hollander's comparisons and contrasts among poets are often beguiling, as in his consideration of Edgar Lee Masters, Robert Louis Stevenson, and the relationship between poetry and dreaming. His imagination is unpredictable and stimulating, especially when he does not assume too much about his audience's familiarity with, or views on, poetry. He smites, he laments, but he also enlightens. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Although the material is of property/casualty origins, the methods presented have potential application in other insurance areas including health insurance and risk management. The text contains a number of worked examples and end-of-chapter exercises. The fourth edition reverses the order of chapters three and four from previous editions. The estimation of the ultimate claim payments is a necessary first step in both the loss reserving process and ratemaking process. Determining the ultimate losses is more comprehensively covered in the loss reserving chapter, and the ratemaking process often relies on the estimates of ultimate losses determined in the loss reserving process. As a result, the loss reserving chapter now comes before the ratemaking chapter. The frequency and severity section of the loss reserving chapter has been revised to demonstrate the closure method of estimating ultimate losses. The chapter on intermediate topics has been updated to include deductible pricing, as this alternative approach to the ratemaking in chapter four is typically used for pricing various deductible options. Finally, the fourth edition has been updated to reflect industry changes and includes even more exercises than previous editions.</p><p></p><h2>Dubliners</h2><p>"Don't you think there is a certain resemblance between the mystery of the Mass and what I am trying to do?...To give people some kind of intellectual pleasure or spiritual enjoyment by converting the bread of everyday life into something that has a permanent artistic life of its own."<br><br>-- James Joyce, in a letter to his brother<br><br>With these fifteen stories James Joyce reinvented the art of fiction, using a scrupulous, deadpan realism to convey truths that were at once blasphemous and sacramental. Whether writing about the death of a fallen priest ("The Sisters"), the petty sexual and fiscal machinations of "Two Gallants," or of the Christmas party at which an uprooted intellectual discovers just how little he really knows about his wife ("The Dead"), Joyce takes narrative places it had never been before.<br><br>The text of this edition has been newly edited by Hans Walter Gabler and Walter Hettche and is followed by a new afterword, chronology, and bibliography by John S. Kelly. Also included in a special appendix are the original versions of three stories as well as Joyce's long-suppressed Preface to Dubliners.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses.

Since then he&#x2019;s been living quietly, working as a part time fishing guide and co-owner of a local bait shop&#x2014;with an unnamed visitor coming around occasionally to see if he&#x2019;s regained any memories. <p></p>But this time, the visitor shows up looking for his help&#x2014;and creating potential mayhem in Stoney&#x2019;s life to prove he&#x2019;s serious. In exchange for making those problems go away, Stoney must go to the far corner of Maine, sign on as a guide at a high end fishing lodge, and look into a couple of suspicious deaths. A govern ment &#x2018;operative&#x2019; was found shot dead in a staged murder/suicide pact involving a local sixteen year old girl. Now Stoney has to uncover what the dead agent was investigating and got him killed&#x2014;without being killed by the very same people.</p><p>William G. Tapply was a contributing editor to<i> Field &amp; Stream</i> and the author of numerous books on fishing and wildlife, as well as more than twenty novels, including his books featuring "Stoney" Calhoun. He lived in Hancock, New Hampshire.Stoney Calhoun goes undercover in Tapply's diverting third mystery to feature the Portland, Maine, bait shop owner who lost his memory in a lightning strike years before (after 2007's <i>Gray Ghost</i>). Despite this tragedy, Stoney retains the skills that make him valuable to the local police as a volunteer deputy as well as to the Man in the Suit, who works for a government agency and periodically shows up to ask Stoney's help. Stoney's latest job for his mysterious employer takes him to an exclusive resort in far northern Maine as a fishing guide to unobtrusively investigate the murder of a federal agent named McNulty and the 16-year-old girl who was with McNulty. Stoney's technique of making anyone with a secret uncomfortable enough to give him or herself away leads to more murders among the small group of resort staff and owners. Sadly, Tapply died July 28, 2009, but fans can expect one more book in his long-running Brady Coyne series (<i>Hell Bent</i>, etc.). <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet arguably his greatest legacy was not in the field of music&#x2014;a talented, precise artist, McEwen revolutionized the field of botanical art.<br><br>Inspired by the old masters throughout his childhood training in art, McEwen developed a distinctive style of botanical illustration. He approached each portrait with scientific precision, capturing the individual contours of each plant instead of offering up an unrealistic ideal. Drawn on plain backgrounds without shadows, often on unadorned vellum, the resulting paintings are extraordinarily realistic, as if a rose-colored petal or sharp green leaf were suspended on the canvas, ready to be touched. McEwen was a master at balancing technical accuracy and artistic flair, without ever compromising one for the other.<br><br><i>Rory McEwen The Colours of Reality </i>brings together over one hundred of his illustrations in a collection that celebrates McEwen&#x2019;s art and artistic ability. Full-color artwork is featured alongside essays that explore his botanical work, his influence on fellow artists, and his other talents for music, poetry, and sculpture. It is a lavish tribute and the first major collection of McEwen&#x2019;s work in decades. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, <i>Rory McEwen The Colours of Reality</i> will delight old fans while drawing in many new ones.</p><p><b>Martyn Rix </b>is editor of <i>Curtis&#x2019;s Botanical Magazine</i> and author or editor of numerous books, including <i>The Golden Age of Botanical Art</i>, <i>The Genus Lachenalia</i>, and <i>Subtropical and Dry Climate Plants: The Definitive Practical Guide</i>.&nbsp;It seems odd that a singer, musician, television performer and sculptor who typified the 1960s as vividly as Rory McEwen should now be known principally for his botanical paintings. From the early 1950s until his tragically early death in 1982 he was everywhere and knew everyone, but as The Colours of Reality shows, McEwen was never more himself than when working within the discipline and timeless tradition of an art form that links him with the greatest flower painters of the past. Not every botanical painter can count Jim Dine, Joseph Beuys and Ravi Shankar as his friends, play the 12-string guitar, shoot at Balmoral, influence Van Morrison, bolster the fortunes of the Wakefield and North of England Tulip Society and drive a purple Ferrari with `Ecosse&#39; on the tail. The natural world, though, was his compulsion: I paint flowers as a way of getting as close as possible to what I perceive as the truth, my truth of the time in which I live. This mostly means looking, looking and thinking... It is impossible not to see in his extraordinary studies of decaying leaves a reflection of his own mortality, but these are not mere vanitas paintings. He imbued everything he painted with an anthropomorphic life, and in his hands a curved stem, a bent head, a wrinkled skin or an infestation of insects is a celebration of individuality rather than dispassionate botanical observation.Often the arrangement of plants seems to speak of relationships - two anemones look like birds conducting an elaborate courtship ritual, fritillaries are apparently holding hands - but these are illustrations that need close scrutiny rather than description. Revised and reprinted after the hugely successful monographic exhibition at Kew two years ago, this elegant book with its beautiful reproductions and sumptuous `negative spaces&#39; does full justice not just to the botanical works, but to the story as a whole of an artist who seems to have touched the lives of everyone who ever knew him.</p><h2>The Sculler at Ease</h2><p>The Sculler at Ease is a unique book on sculling and rowing by a veteran American coach.

By the author of Killed in the Ratings.</p><p>As v-p in charge of special projects at a fictional television network in New York City, Matt Cobb is used to handling delicate egos and tricky situations. In this instance, Matt, whose job security is reinforced by his romantic relationship with the network's leading shareholder, must ease the paranoia of talk-show host Richard Bentyne, who has an old lover, a new lover, a hit show and morbid delusions on a grand scale. But Bentyne's delusions prove well-founded when he is fatally poisoned just before Clement Bates, a famous, wealthy eccentric whom no one but Bentyne has seen for 35 years, is due to appear on his show. Cobb often cracks wise and is frequently very funny; the suspect pool is more than deep enough; and the solution, tying up more murder and assorted motives, manages to play fair on all counts. The fringe time of the title is apparently media-speak for the period after the late news and before the morning news and chat shows, and in DeAndrea's able hands, it's a very scary place. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Series protagonist Matt Cobb, a vice president for a New York-based television network, tries to control Richard Bentyne, the network's expensive new talk-show host. Bentyne's successful but offensive mix of rude, crude, and "cool" annoys some guests and co-workers. Therefore, it is not surprising when someone kills him.

Set in a small mid-American town, it begins with a coal-mine explosion that claims ninety-seven lives. Giovanni Bruno--hawk-faced, silent, some say deranged--is the only survivor. A lapsed Catholic given to peculiar visions, Bruno is adopted as a prophet by a group of secretive small-town mystics. "Exposed" by the town newspaper editor, the Brunist cult gains international notoriety and its ranks swell. As its members gather on the Mount of Redemption--above the site of the mine disaster--to await the apocalypse, and the fabric of the community begins to unravel, Robert Coover lays bare the madness of religious frenzy and the sometime greater madness of "normal" citizens. The Origin of the Brunists is vintage Coover-fearless, incisive, and brilliantly executed. <p>"A novel of intensity and conviction...[Coover] may become heir to Dreiser or Lewis.... He has splendid talent."--The New York Times Book Review </p><p>"A breathtaking masterpiece on any level you approach it."--Sol Yurick, author of An Island Death </p><p>"[The Origin of the Brunists] delivers the goods; it explodes on the reader...says what it has to say with rudeness, vigor, poetry and a headlong narrative momentum."--The Plain Dealer (Cleveland) </p><p>Robert Coover has won fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts, and has been the recipient of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, the Rea Award for the short story, and the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction, among other honors. He has taught at Bard College, the University of Iowa, Princeton University and currently teaches electronic and experimental writing at Brown University.</p>Robert Coover has published fourteen novels, three short story collections, and a collection of plays since The Origin of the Brunists received the The William Faulkner Foundation First Novel Award in 1966. At Brown University, where he has taught for over thirty years, he established the International Writers Project, a program that provides an annual fellowship and safe haven to endangered international writers who face harassment, imprisonment, and suppression of their work in their home countries. In 1990-91, he launched the world's first hypertext fiction workshop, was one of the founders in 1999 of the Electronic Literature Organization, and in 2002 created CaveWriting, the first writing workshop in immersive virtual reality. Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times has said Of all the postmodern writers, Robert Coover is probably the funniest and most malicious, mixing up broad social and political satire with vaudeville turns, lewd pratfalls, and clever word plays that make us rethink both the mechanics of the world and our relationship to it.&#x201d; Coover has also received awards from the Lannan Foundation, American Academy of Arts and Letters, National Endowment of the Arts, and the Rea Lifetime Short Story Award.</p><h2>Look-alikes Around the World (An Album of Amazing Postcards)</h2><p>Look-Alikes Around the World: An Album of Amazing Postcards [ Look-Alikes Around the World: An Album of Amazing Postcards by Steiner, Joan ( Author ) Hardcover Sep- 2007 ] Hardcover Sep- 01- 2007</p><p></p><h2>Rocky Mountain Flower Finder: A Guide to the Wildflowers Found Below Tree Line in the Rocky Mountains (Nature Study Guides)</h2><p>Pocket field guide to wildflowers of the Rockies, from foothills to tree line.

Inside, on lined pages, Amelia writes about her recent move to a new town, doodles pictures of people she meets and saves such mementos as postage stamps and a birthday candle. She misses her best friend, Nadia, but her moments of sadness are balanced by optimism-she distracts herself by drawing and by writing short stories. In appropriately conversational terms, Amelia complains that her big sister invades her privacy ("So Cleo if you are reading this right now-BUG OFF and STAY OUT"); gripes about cafeteria food ("Henna says they use dog food. I believe it!"); and jokes in classic elementary-school gross-out fashion. Readers will understand Amelia's wish to put her "top secret" thoughts on paper, and they'll notice that even though she's uneasy about attending a different school, she's starting over successfully.

Twenty years later, this gripping thriller about a thriving international black market in human hearts, livers and kidneys could come from tomorrow's "Nightline." Author Gerritsen was an internist before she switched her energies to writing, and her experience shows in every scene. When young surgical resident Dr. Abby DiMatteo assists at her first "harvest" (the removal of living organs from a patient declared legally brain dead) at Boston's posh Bayside Hospital, "she felt vaguely nauseated by the whine of the blade, the smell of bone dust," neither of which seem to bother the veterans. It's obviously a personal memory being mined for good fictional purposes. (Gerritsen wrote paperback romance novels before <b>Harvest</b>: Check out her Keeper of the Bride and Thief of Hearts.)In a novel of harrowing suspense and brilliantly crafted plot twists, author Tess Gerritsen draws on her years of experience as a doctor to deliver an explosive thriller that makes her an indisputable star. HARVEST vividly portrays a young woman doctor challenging a world where medical miracles and greed fuel a lethal conspiracy-and the bright lights of the O.R. conceal the ultimate corruption of genius. Unerringly authentic, with scalpel-sharp characterizations that rival Patricia Cornwell's HARVEST is an astounding debut.... <p> <b>HARVEST <br> TESS GERRITSEN</b> </p><p> For Dr. Abby DiMatteo, the road to Boston's Bayside Hospital began with a tragic accident-and the desperate, awful weeks that followed as she watched her little brother, Pete, lose his battle to live. Despite her small-town roots and lack of money, Abby pushed through college and medical school, each achievement strengthening her ambition to reach higher. Now, immersed in the grinding fatigue of her second year as a surgical resident, she's elated when the hospital's elite cardiac transplant team taps her as a potential recruit. </p><p> But Abby soon makes an anguished, crucial decision that jeopardizes her entire career. A car crash victim's healthy heart is ready to be harvested; it is immediately cross-matched to a wealthy private patient, forty-six-year-old Nina Voss. Abby and chief resident Vivian Chao hatch a bold plan to make sure that the transplant goes instead to a dying seventeen-year-old boy who is also a perfect match. </p><p> The repercussions are powerful and swift; Dr. Chao resigns, bowing under the combined fury of the hospital's top staff and Nina Voss's outraged husband. Abby is shaken but unrepentant-until she meets the frail, tormented Nina. Then a new heart for Nina Voss suddenly appears, her transplant is completed, and Abby makes a terrible discovery. The donor records have been falsified-Nina's heart has not come through the proper channels. </p><p> Defying Bayside Hospital's demands for silence, Abby, with Vivian Chao's help, plunges into an investigation that reveals an intricate, and murderous, chain of deceptions. Every move Abby makes spawns a vicious backlash... and, in a ship anchored in the stagnant waters of Boston Harbor, a final, grisly discovery lies waiting.... </p><p> As compelling as the best Michael Crichton of Michael Palmer, more provocative than tomorrow's headlines, HARVEST is a mesmerizing read-and Tess Gerritsen proves herself to be a new master of first-class suspense fiction.</p></p><h2>La belleza de saber vivir / The Beauty of Knowing How to Live (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Advises women on how to follow their innate moral sense to discover and achieve their reason for being and purpose in life by reaching nine goals--acceptance, focus, balance, leadership, optimism, gratitude, forgiveness, dignity, and faith.</p><p><b></b> <b><i>B�rbara Palacios</i></b>, autora, conferencista&nbsp; y empresaria, es una figura reconocida en Am�rica Latina y entre los hispanos de los Estados Unidos. <br>El resultado de sus experiencias como presentadora de televisi�n, portavoz publicitaria y como Miss Universo 86, la condujeron a convertirse en una figura de inspiraci�n y orientaci�n a quienes han seguido su trayectoria. <p>B�rbara esta casada , es madre de dos hijos y vive en los Estados Unidos.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Turn Coat</h2><p>Meet Harry Dresden, Chicago&#39;s first (and only) Wizard P.I. Turns out the &#39;everyday&#39; world is full of strange and magical things - and most of them don&#39;t play well with humans. That&#39;s where Harry comes in. Harry has always tried to keep his nose clean where the White Council of Wizards is concerned, but past misdeeds haven&#39;t gone down well. Which places him in an awkward position. Morgan, formerly his chief persecutor on the Council, has been wrongly accused of treason. Facing the ultimate punishment, Morgan needs someone with a knack for backing the underdog, however much that someone isn&#39;t interested. Soon, Harry is working to clear the less-than-agreeable Morgan&#39;s name, hiding from the Council and bounty hunters alike and seeking the true turncoat. A single mistake may mean that heads - quite literally - could roll. And one of them might be his. Magic - it can get a guy killed.</p><p>As well as being a bestselling author, Jim Butcher is a martial arts enthusiast with fifteen years of experience in various styles.

I&#x2019;ve been facing the kinds of problems authors only dream about having, and you all have been a tremendous help to me. With luck, I&#x2019;ll figure out how best to repay you for the time and effort you&#x2019;ve all given me.</p><p>And, always, for Shannon and JJ, who like me even when I vanish into my own head for days at a time.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>T</b>he summer sun was busy broiling the asphalt from Chicago&#x2019;s streets, the agony in my head had kept me horizontal for half a day, and some idiot was pounding on my apartment door.</p><p>I answered it and Morgan, half his face covered in blood, gasped, &#x201c;The Wardens are coming. Hide me. Please.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes rolled back into his skull and he collapsed.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Super.</p><p>Up until that moment, I&#x2019;d been laboring under the misapprehension that the splitting pain in my skull would be the worst thing to happen to me today.</p><p>&#x201c;Hell&#x2019;s frickin&#x2019; bells!&#x201d; I blurted at Morgan&#x2019;s unconscious form. &#x201c;You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me!&#x201d; I was really, really tempted to slam the door and leave him lying there in a heap. He sure as hell deserved it.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t just stand there doing nothing, though.</p><p>&#x201c;You need to get your head examined,&#x201d; I muttered to myself. Then I deactivated my wards&#x2014;the magical security system I&#x2019;ve got laid over my apartment&#x2014;grabbed Morgan under the arms, and hauled him inside. He was a big man, over six feet, with plenty of muscle&#x2014;and he was completely limp. I had a hard time moving him, even though I&#x2019;m no junior petite myself.</p><p>I shut the door behind me and brought my wards back up. Then I waved a hand at my apartment in general, focused my will, and muttered, <i>&#x201c;Flickum bicus.&#x201d;</i> A dozen candles spaced around the room flickered to life as I pronounced the simple spell, and I knelt beside the unconscious Morgan, examining him for injuries.</p><p>He had half a dozen nasty cuts, oozing and ugly and probably painful, but not life-threatening. The flesh on his ribs, beneath his left arm, was blistered and burned, and his plain white shirt had been scorched away. He also had a deep wound in one leg that was clumsily wrapped in what looked like a kitchen apron. I didn&#x2019;t dare unwrap the thing. It could start the bleeding again, and my medical skills are nothing I&#x2019;d want to bet a life on.</p><p>Even Morgan&#x2019;s life.</p><p>He needed a doctor.</p><p>Unfortunately, if the Wardens of the White Council were pursuing him, they probably knew he was wounded. They would, therefore, be watching hospitals. If I took him to one of the local emergency rooms, the Council would know about it within hours.</p><p>So I called a friend.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Waldo Butters studied Morgan&#x2019;s injuries in silence for a few moments, while I hovered. He was a wiry little guy, and his black hair stood up helter-skelter, like the fur of a frightened cat. He wore green hospital scrubs and sneakers, and his hands were swift and nimble. He had dark and very intelligent eyes behind black wire-rimmed spectacles, and looked like he hadn&#x2019;t slept in two weeks.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a doctor,&#x201d; Butters said.</p><p>We&#x2019;d done this dance several times. &#x201c;You are the Mighty Butters,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You can do anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a medical examiner. I cut up corpses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If it helps, think of this as a preventative autopsy.&#x201d;</p><p>Butters gave me an even look and said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t take him to the hospital, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>Butters shook his head. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t this the guy who tried to kill you that one Halloween?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And a few other times before that,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He opened a medical kit and started rummaging through it. &#x201c;I was never really clear on why.&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;When I was a kid, I killed a man with magic. I was captured by the Wardens and tried by the White Council.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess you got off.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;But they figured that since I was just trying to survive the guy killing me with magic, maybe I deserved a break. Suspended sentence, sort of. Morgan was my probation officer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Probation?&#x201d; Butters asked.</p><p>&#x201c;If I screwed up again, he was supposed to chop my head off. He followed me around looking for a good excuse to do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Butters blinked up at me, surprised.</p><p>&#x201c;I spent the first several years of my adult life looking over my shoulder, worrying about this guy. Getting hounded and harassed by him. I had nightmares for a while, and he was in them.&#x201d; Truth be told, I <i>still</i> had nightmares occasionally, about being pursued by an implacable killer in a grey cloak, holding a wicked cold sword.</p><p>Butters began to wet the bandages over the leg wound. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re helping him?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;He thought I was a dangerous animal and needed to be put down. He really believed it, and acted accordingly.&#x201d;</p><p>Butters gave me a quick glance. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re <i>helping</i> him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He was wrong,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t make him a villain. It just makes him an asshole. It isn&#x2019;t reason enough to kill him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Reconciled, eh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not especially.&#x201d;</p><p>Butters lifted his eyebrows. &#x201c;Then why&#x2019;d he come to <i>you</i> for help?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last place anyone would look for him be my guess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus Christ,&#x201d; Butters muttered. He&#x2019;d gotten the improvised bandage off, and found a wound maybe three inches long, but deep, its edges puckered like a little mouth. Blood began drooling from it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a knife wound, but bigger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s probably because it was done with something like a knife, but bigger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A sword?&#x201d; Butters said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Council&#x2019;s old school,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Really, really, <i>really</i> old school.&#x201d;</p><p>Butters shook his head. &#x201c;Wash your hands the way I just did. Do it thorough&#x2014;takes two or three minutes. Then get a pair of gloves on and get back here. I need an extra pair of hands.&#x201d;</p><p>I swallowed. &#x201c;Uh. Butters, I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;m the right guy to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh bite me, wizard boy,&#x201d; Butters said, his tone annoyed. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t got a moral leg to stand on. If it&#x2019;s okay that I&#x2019;m not a doctor, it&#x2019;s okay that you aren&#x2019;t a nurse. So wash your freaking hands and help me before we lose him.&#x201d;</p><p>I stared at Butters helplessly for a second. Then I got up and washed my freaking hands.</p><p>For the record, surgeries aren&#x2019;t pretty. There&#x2019;s a hideous sense of intimately inappropriate exposure to another human being, and it feels something like accidentally walking in on a naked parent. Only there&#x2019;s more gore. Bits are exposed that just shouldn&#x2019;t be out in the open, and they&#x2019;re covered in blood. It&#x2019;s embarrassing, disgusting, and unsettling all at the same time.</p><p>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; Butters said, an infinity later. &#x201c;Okay, let go. Get your hands out of my way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It cut the artery?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, hell no,&#x201d; Butters said. &#x201c;Whoever stabbed him barely nicked it. Otherwise he&#x2019;d be dead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s fixed, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For some definitions of &#x2018;fixed.&#x2019; Harry, this is meatball surgery of the roughest sort, but the wound should stay closed as long as he doesn&#x2019;t go walking around on it. And he should get looked at by a real doctor soonest.&#x201d; He frowned in concentration. &#x201c;Just give me a minute to close up here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take all the time you need.&#x201d;</p><p>Butters fell silent while he worked, and didn&#x2019;t speak again until after he&#x2019;d finished sewing the wound closed and covered the site in bandages. Then he turned his attention to the smaller injuries, closing most of them with bandages, suturing a particularly ugly one. He also applied a topical antibiotic to the burn, and carefully covered it in a layer of gauze.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Butters said. &#x201c;I sterilized everything as best I could, but it wouldn&#x2019;t shock me to see an infection anyway. He starts running a fever, or if there&#x2019;s too much swelling, you&#x2019;ve got to get him to one of two places&#x2014;the hospital or the morgue.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; I said quietly.</p><p>&#x201c;We should get him onto a bed. Get him warm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>We lifted Morgan by the simple expedient of picking up the entire area rug he was lying on, and settled him down on the only bed in the place, the little twin in my closet-sized bedroom. We covered him up.</p><p>&#x201c;He really ought to have a saline IV going,&#x201d; Butters said. &#x201c;For that matter, a unit of blood couldn&#x2019;t hurt, either. And he needs antibiotics, man, but I can&#x2019;t write prescriptions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll handle it,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Butters grimaced at me, his dark eyes concerned. He started to speak and then stopped, several times.</p><p>&#x201c;Harry,&#x201d; he said, finally. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re <i>on</i> the White Council, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you <i>are</i> a Warden, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>Butters shook his head. &#x201c;So, your own people are after this guy. I can&#x2019;t imagine that they&#x2019;ll be very happy with you if they find him here.&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re always upset about something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious. This is nothing but trouble for you. So why help him?&#x201d;</p><p>I was quiet for a moment, looking down at Morgan&#x2019;s slack, pale, unconscious face.</p><p>&#x201c;Because Morgan wouldn&#x2019;t break the Laws of Magic,&#x201d; I said quietly. &#x201c;Not even if it cost him his life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sound pretty sure about that.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;I am. I&#x2019;m helping him because I know what it feels like to have the Wardens on your ass for something you haven&#x2019;t done.&#x201d; I rose and looked away from the unconscious man on my bed. &#x201c;I know it better than anyone alive.&#x201d;</p><p>Butters shook his head. &#x201c;You are a rare kind of crazy, man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>He started cleaning up everything he&#x2019;d set out during the improvised surgery. &#x201c;So. How are the headaches?&#x201d;</p><p>They&#x2019;d been a problem, the past several months&#x2014;increasingly painful migraines. &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I told him.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; Butters said. &#x201c;I really wish you&#x2019;d try the MRI again.&#x201d;</p><p>Technology and wizards don&#x2019;t coexist well, and magnetic resonance imagers are right up there. &#x201c;One baptism in fire-extinguishing foam per year is my limit,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;It could be something serious,&#x201d; Butters said. &#x201c;Anything happens in your head or neck, you don&#x2019;t take chances. There&#x2019;s way too much going on there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re lightening up,&#x201d; I lied.</p><p>&#x201c;Hogwash,&#x201d; Butters said, giving me a gimlet stare. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a headache now, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked from Butters to Morgan&#x2019;s recumbent form. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I sure as hell got one now.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p><b>M</b>organ slept.

As she followed the girl shows from town to town, she portrayed the dancers on stage and off, photographing their public performances as well as their private lives. She also taped interviews with the dancers, their boyfriends, the show managers and paying customers. Meiselas' frank description of the lives of these women brought a hidden world to public attention. Produced during the early years of the women's movement, <i>Carnival Strippers</i> reflects the struggle for identity and self-esteem that characterized a complex era of change. This revised edition contains a new selection of Meiselas' black-and-white photographs together with the original interview excerpts. Additionally, an audio CD featuring a collage of participants' voices and a 1977 interview with the photographer are included. Essays by Sylvia Wolf and Deirdre English reflect on the importance of this body of work within the history of photography and the history of feminism.</p><p></p><h2>Isolation (Faye Longchamp Archaeological Mysteries, 9)</h2><p><p><strong>Florida Book Awards Finalist</strong></p><p><strong>"A worthwhile addition to Faye's long-running series that weaves history, mystery, and psychology into a satisfying tale of greed and passion." &#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><em></em></p><p>Archaeologist Faye Longchamp-Mantooth has dug herself a deep hole and she can't make her way out of it. As she struggles to recover from a shattering personal loss, she sees that everyone she loves is trying to reach out to her. If only she could reach back. Instead she's out digging holes all over her home, the Florida island of Joyeuse.</p><p>In their old plantation home, Joe Wolf Mantooth is surrounded by family&#x2015;Faye, the wife he loves; their toddler son he adores; and his father, who hasn't gotten around to telling him how long he's been out of prison or how he got there&#x2015;yet Joe has never felt so helpless or alone.</p><p>Then a close friend at the local marina is brutally murdered, the first in a string of crimes against women that rocks Micco County. Joe, desperate to help Faye, realizes she is in danger from both her inner demons and someone who has breached the island's isolation. Local law and environmental officials say they want to help, but to Faye and Joe they feel more like invaders. A struggling Faye reaches back over a century into her family's history for clues. And all the while, danger snakes further into their lives, threatening the people they love, their cherished home, even the very ground&#x2015;some of it poisoned&#x2015;beneath their feet.</p></p><p><p><strong>Mary Anna Evans</strong>&nbsp;is the author of the Faye Longchamp archaeological mysteries, which have received recognition including the Benjamin Franklin Award, the Mississippi Author Award, and three Florida Book Awards bronze medals.

Archaeologist Faye Longchamp-Mantooth is in a deep depression after suffering a miscarriage and losing her baby daughter. Her husband, Joe Wolf Mantooth, is holding things together, caring for their son, Michael, and dealing with a visit from his long-estranged father, Sly Mantooth. Faye spends her time aimlessly digging holes on Joyeuse Island, her home off the Florida coast, until one day she digs into an old tank that's releasing some noxious fluid. When the crew from the EPA arrives, they find elevated amounts of arsenic in the soil. On the mainland, Faye's friend Liz Colton has been murdered and a local boat mechanic caught dumping noxious substances in the water. Faye's been trying to avoid Oscar Croft, a wealthy Ohio native convinced that his Civil War officer ancestor was held prisoner nearby by a crazy woman who sent his sword home to his wife. Working for Oscar is Delia Scarsdale, an attractive genealogist determined to track down information on Cally Stanton. Faye's unwilling to admit that Cally is her great-great-grandmother, a former slave who owned Joyeuse and left an unpublished memoir mentioning the Civil War officer. Could the murder, the contamination, and the search for information about the past all be related? Faye, who feels compelled to look for answers, puts her whole family in grave danger, but what she finds turns out to be her salvation. A worthwhile addition to Faye's long-running series (Rituals, 2013, etc.) that weaves history, mystery, and psychology into a satisfying tale of greed and passion.

Religious concepts, ideas, doctrines, strategies, methods,techniques, formulas, "its" and "things" have all eclipsedthe beauty, the glory, and the reality of the Lord Jesus Himself. On the whole,Christians today are starved for a real experience of the living Christ. Weknow a lot <i>about </i>our Lord, but we don't know <i>Him </i>very well. Weknow a lot about trying to be like Jesus, but very little about living by Hisindwelling life.</p><p><b>JESUS MANIFESTO</b> presents a fresh unveiling of Jesus as not only Savior andLord, but as so much more. It is a prophetic call to restore the supremacy andsovereignty of Christ in a world-and a church-that has lost sight of Him. </p><p>Every revival and restoration in the church has been arediscovery of some aspect of Christ in the process of answering the ultimatequestion that Jesus put to His disciples: <b>"Whodo you say that I am?" </b></p><p>Read this book and see your Lordlike you've neverseen Him before. </p></p><p><p>Frank Viola has helped thousands of people around the world to deepen their relationship with Jesus Christ and enter into a more vibrant and authentic experience of church. His mission is to help serious followers of Jesus know their Lord more deeply so they can experience real transformation and make a lasting impact. Viola has written many books on these themes, including God's Favorite Place on Earth, From Eternity to Here, and Jesus Manifesto (with Leonard Sweet). His blog, frankviola.org, is rated as one of the most popular in Christian circles today.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>The Christian church is falling apart and in desperate need of a revival. According to professor Sweet (The Church in Emerging Culture: Five Perspectives) and bestselling author Viola (From Eternity to Here), �what is lacking is a groundbreaking revelation of Christ that boggles the mind and enraptures the heart.� Expanding on the authors� 2009 online manifesto, this insistent, impassioned essay condemns as pharisaic those preachers who forgo a Christ-centered theology in favor of a cute, singular slogan or mission. The authors urge churches to focus on the man who embodies the entire religion. To do so, readers must learn the subtle distinction between following Christ and realizing Christ already lives within them. Some may find this message controversial, even pantheistic. Yet the biblical passages show the message is rooted in Scripture. The authors provide a lot to digest, but quotations from poets and philosophers break up the text and help readers grasp abstract concepts. Though most applicable to pastors and seminarians, all Christian readers will discover a new perspective and deeper purpose. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Patricia and Fredrick McKissack live in St. Louis, Missouri. John McKissack resides in Memphis, Tennessee. <br>Gr. 6-10. This book goes far beyond the few familiar photographs and names most readers associate with the Negro Baseball Leagues, and it makes the trip in style. We discover, for example, that George Washington's troops were "batting balls and running bases" and that the nineteenth-century relationship between baseball and race was more diverse than many young readers may realize. The McKissacks carefully record the differences of opinion about some events and the difficulty of finding source material. Oral histories from surviving players add startling depth to descriptions of conditions of play and travel, and Jackie Robinson's entry into major league ball becomes a richer and more complicated moment because the authors show where Robinson came from (and how) in addition to where he went. A player roster will be helpful to students, and a time line carefully weaves together the sports world and the world of lynchings, race riots, the Civil War, and the incandescent electric lamp. <i>Mary Harris Veeder</i></p><h2>Royal Secrets: The View from Downstairs</h2><p>A backstairs account of the British royal family by Prince Charles&#39;s former valet</p><p></p><h2>Booktrek: Selected Essays on Artists&#x2019; Books since 1972 (Documents)</h2><p>Clive Phillpot has been a tireless advocate for the artist&#x2019;s book for more than 40 years--both as a critic, curator and editor, and in his tenure as director at the library of The Museum of Modern Art in the late 1970s, where he built the library&#x2019;s collection of artist&#x2019;s books and mapped out the field with influential essays that traced its ancestry and distinguished it from seemingly similar genres such as the livre d&#x2019;artiste.

In 1960, a young American woman, Elizabeth Hawley, moved to Nepal as a reporter for Time Inc. Initially sending home political dispatches from the kingdom, it wasn&#x2019;t long before Hawley&#x2019;s pen found its niche: mountaineering in the world&#x2019;s highest places. She quickly became part of the Kathmandu scene, socializing regularly with an eclectic group of adventurers, climbers, royalty, politicians and entrepreneurs. Hawley is still in Kathmandu today and has been the unofficial chronicler of every detail of every expedition mounted from Nepal in the Himalaya for more than four decades. </p><p>What would motivate this single American woman, the product of a Midwest upbringing, to travel solo during this era to one of the most remote and enigmatic places on the globe? How did she command the respect of climbers from around the world (some of whom report fear of her sharp tongue and rigorous interview style)? How did she remain an authoritative figure for 40 years during the most intense climbing of this region&#x2014;the "Golden Era of Himalayan Climbing"? What changes did she see take place in mountaineering and in the political landscape of this region? </p><p>Although the intensely private Ms. Hawley is an enigma even to those who know her well, I&#x2019;ll Call You in Kathmandu reveals Hawley as a complex personality, with a rich personal life.</p></p><p>She left America in the 1950s to travel the world--and although she's never climbed a mountain, she became one of the most important figures in Himalayan climbing history. <p>In the post-World War II era when few women lived life on their own terms, a young Elizabeth Hawley left her job as a researcher for Fortune magazine in New York and set out to travel the globe. Nepal--exotic, remote, on the cusp of entry into the modern world--captured her imagination. In 1960 she returned to Kathmandu, single and alone, and over the next four decades built a life that even she could not have envisioned. </p><p>Initially reporting on politics and culture for Reuters and Time Inc., she quickly became part of the Kathmandu scene, an eclectic cast of mountaineers, adventurers, politicians, and entrepreneurs, ranging from Sir Edmund Hillary to Nepalese royalty, from Colonel Jimmy Roberts to Reinhold Messner, from Boris Lissanevitch to Babu Chiri. But the golden age of Himalayan climbing had dawned and soon Hawley found her place in it: a historian revered as the final word on mountaineering achievements on the roof of the world. Hawley is still in Kathmandu today, carrying on her work well into her eighties. </p><p>How did this woman, who has never climbed a mountain or visited Everest base camp, become the top authority the climbing world depends on to document, authenticate, and evaluate the significance of expeditions in the Nepal Himalaya? How did she command the respect of elite mountaineers (some of whom report fear of her sharp tongue and relentless probing)? What are her personal views on the storied feats, notorious scandals, and great tragedies of Himalayan climbing history? What does she really think of climbing legends Hillary, Messner, Chris Bonnington, Tomaz Humar, Ed Viesturs, and more? </p><p>What of her rumored romances with famous climbers? What of the tumultuous political and social change she has witnessed in Nepal over more than forty years? </p><p>Bernadette McDonald journeyed to Nepal to find out. In addition to extensive interviews with Hawley, celebrated mountaineers, and Kathmandu intimates, McDonald had full access to Hawley's meticulous records and correspondence. I'll Call You in Kathmandu reveals the intensely private Ms. Hawley as a complex individual with a rich personal life. It is fitting tribute to the woman who figures so prominently in the history of mountaineering.</p>"I'll Call You in Kathmandu is much more than an admirable biography of an intriguing woman. While throwing open the curtains on the enigmatic life of Elizabeth Hawley, Bernadette McDonald provides a crash course in the history of Himalayan mountaineering, crammed with engaging renderings of the numerous characters whose lives intersected with Hawley's over the past 45 years in Kathmandu&#x2014;a quirky cast ranging from Sir Edmund Hillary to Hillary Clinton, Boris Lissanevitch to Babu Chiri, Reinhold Messner to Jimmy Carter."&#x2014;Jon Krakauer <p>"No one has a wider knowledge of Himalayan mountaineering [than Elizabeth Hawley]. She is respected and admired by all the famous climbers...I am particularly pleased that her unique and eventful life has finally been documented, as she has lived through interesting times, in fascinating places, with some remarkable people. May she long remain her very special, formidable self."&#x2014;Sir Edmund Hillary </p><p>"There is just one person who knows all about the history of Himalayan climbing, from the first ascent of Mount Everest by Hillary and Tenzing to our days: Elizabeth Hawley.

The clothes that came out were covered in dirt, moss, and some other things that looked like they were moving.<br><br>"I never said you were." Her oldest friend's voice was soothing, and Carter recognized the tone. It was the same one that had gotten her into trouble when they were teenage girls.<br><br>"Yeah, well, I'm also not a masochist," she countered, trying to ward off the attraction she felt toward the opportunity. "The guy who owns Farrell Mountain is a real piece of work. He's thrown more of my colleagues off that pile of dirt than a starting pitcher."<br><br>Laughter came over the line. "C.C., I hate sports analogies, and that one barely works."<br><br>Carter decided to fight harder, hoping her plan for taking the summer off wouldn't be ruined by a proposition she couldn't turn down. "Well, from what I've heard, Nick Farrell takes misanthropy to a new level, and he's got a particular distaste for archaeologists. Do you know who he is? The corporate raider whose name was splashed all over the papers because he double-crossed some guy in a business deal?"<br><br>"I know the story and his reputation."<br><br>"So why are you doing this to me?" The words came out in a groan.<br><br>"Because it's about time someone solved this mystery. The story's been left hanging since 1775."<br><br>"It's a fairy tale, Woody."<br><br>"Woody" was more commonly known as Grace Woodward-Hall. The two had first met at a picturesque New England prep school where they'd spent four years specializing in winning field hockey games and smuggling packs of wine coolers into their dorm. They'd been popular thanks to both.<br><br>As adults, they had a personal and a professional relationship. Carter's specialty as a historian and an archaeologist was the colonial period. Grace's family ran the Hall Foundation, one of the nation's largest sources of grants for the discovery and preservation of American history. Carter had received Hall funding for a number of her digs.<br><br>"You've read that Brit's journal, right?" Grace's Upper East Side background marked her words with perfect intonation, but Carter knew the truth. For all her prim and ladylike exterior, Grace had a raucous sense of humor and an affection for trouble, both of which had cemented their relationship.<br><br>"Farnsworth's diary? Of course I've read it. All colonial historians have a copy. It comes with the bizarre predilection for musket balls and minutemen."<br><br>Carter glanced down and saw a spider crawling out from under a pair of khakis. She wasn't prepared to kill the thing but didn't want it as a housemate, either. Reaching over the washing machine, she picked up a coffee can full of nails, dumped it out on top of the dryer, and covered the arachnid.<br><br>"So you've got to wonder what happened," Grace prompted.<br><br>"I know what happened. An American hero was slaughtered, a fortune in gold disappeared, and the Indian guide was fingered as responsible. End of story."<br><br>"I find it hard to believe," Grace said dryly, "that you aren't struck by all the holes in that narration. Someone needs to go up on Farrell Mountain and find out what happened to the Winship party."<br><br>"Well, it doesn't have to be me." Carter started loading shirts and socks into the washer, careful not to tip over the can. "What they really need is a paranormal investigator to put to rest all that haunting nonsense. Red Hawk's ghost guarding the gold? Give me a break."<br><br>"Look, specters aside, this really is the perfect project for you. In your period, up in the wilderness, a prime piece of history ready for the picking."<br><br>"I just got home from a dig," Carter moaned. "I've got twelve pounds of dirt under my fingernails, I'm in desperate need of sleep, and I have it on good authority there are black flies the size of bats in the Adirondacks this time of year."<br><br>She knew because they were alive and well in the Green Mountains of Vermont, too. Glancing through a screened window, she saw a cheery June day beckoning on the other side but she wasn't fooled. She'd been chewed on by them in her garden that very morning.<br><br>"Aren't you curious about what happened to the gold?"<br><br>"Like I am about the Easter Bunny. You show me some proof that an upright rabbit carrying a basket of chicken eggs exists and maybe I'll believe there's a treasure up in those mountains."<br><br>"Come on, that gold couldn't have disappeared into thin air. And what happened to the remains of the men who were killed?"<br><br>Carter leaned a hip against the washing machine. "The Americans should never have transported that kind of fortune while they had a captured British madman on their hands. They were bound to get ambushed. The only surprise was that Red Hawk was the one who turned on them. If one of the aggressors didn't take the gold, someone else probably found it and had the good sense to keep his mouth shut. As for the bodies, they could be anywhere. You know how big the Adirondack Park is? It would be like winning the lottery to find them."<br><br>She peered over her shoulder into the washer. Hitting that mess with water was going to create some kind of mud bath but there was room to stuff in a little more. She bent down to pick up another pair of khakis.<br><br>"Did I mention we have bones?" Grace drawled. "From a site that's identical to the one Farnsworth described in the journal."<br><br>Carter snapped upright. "Bones? What kind of bones? Where were they found?"<br><br>Grace's satisfaction came through loud and clear over the phone. "Conrad Lyst found them up on Farrell Mountain."<br><br>At the sound of the man's name, Carter's jaw clenched. "That rat. That nasty . . ."<br><br>She allowed herself a couple of truly raunchy but descriptive adjectives. And followed them up with a doozy of a noun.<br><br>"You finished now?" Her friend asked with amusement.<br><br>"Hardly. It's a wonder that man can find his butt in his own pants. And if by some miracle he did, his next move would be to sell it to the highest bidder."<br><br>"Professional rivalries aside--"<br><br>"That bulldozer is no professional. He's a looter and a thief."<br><br>"I can't argue with either of those, but he did find a femur and part of an arm. We examined them here in Boston and they're from the period."<br><br>"That doesn't mean they're from--"<br><br>"They were found with a crucifix."<br><br>Carter forgot all about the laundry. "Any markings?"<br><br>"Winship, 1773. We haven't analyzed it fully yet but it looks legit."<br><br>The Reverend Jonathan Winship had been the one in charge of the colonists escorting the general. He was one of the men who had been killed up in the mountains.<br><br>Carter's heart started pounding in her chest.<br><br>"So, you want to talk about an Easter egg hunt?" Grace inquired smoothly.<br><br>A half hour later they'd ironed out a grant and, though the laundry remained dry in the washer, the spider had been carefully released back into the wild. After pacing around the house for most of the time they talked, Carter ended up in her kitchen, sitting at her breakfast table in the sunshine.<br><br>"I still don't understand why Lyst presented you with the cross," she said. "That's not his style. The more people that know about a find, the harder it is for him to sell it on the black market."<br><br>"He says he wants a grant. We won't give him one, of course. If he did dig, he'd just pocket anything of monetary value and mistreat the rest so it couldn't be studied."<br><br>Carter let out a snort of derision. "Someone needs to take that man's shovel away, and I could tell them right where to stick it. The real mystery is how the hell Lyst got permission to dig on that mountain."<br><br>"He didn't. He trespassed and, as you know, Farrell's idea of a welcome wagon doesn't exactly include zucchini bread and lemonade. Lyst claims some rabid woodsman chased him off with a shotgun, almost killing him in the process."<br><br>"Too bad the guy didn't get the job done."<br><br>"Well, it got Lyst's attention, which may be the reason he came to the foundation. He probably figures a Hall grant will give him credibility when he tries again."<br><br>"He'd go back?"<br><br>"You know Lyst. What he lacks in scruples, he more than makes up for in follow-through. That's why you need to go talk to Farrell right now. I know where his summer house is on Lake Sagamore and you can't live more than an hour away from it. I've heard he's usually there on the weekends this time of year. Just drive over this Saturday and ask for permission to dig."<br><br>"What makes you think the response I get will be any better?"<br><br>"You're going to ask first.

In her brilliantly compelling new book, Alison Weir, author of four highly acclaimed chronicles of English royalty, paints a unique portrait of these four extraordinary rulers, examining their intricate relationships to each other and to history.<br><br>Weir opens her narrative with the death of Henry and the accession of the boy king Edward VI. Often portrayed as weak and sickly, Edward, in fact had a keen intelligence and a flair for leadership. Had he not contracted a fatal disease at the age of fifteen, Edward might have become one of England's great kings. Instead, his brief reign was marked by vicious court intrigue that took the monarchy to the verge of bankruptcy.<br><br>Edward's death in 1553 plunged England into chaos, and it was in this explosive atmosphere that the ill-fated Lady Jane Grey was crowned Queen of England. A fragile, intellectual girl, Jane was only too happy to end her nine-day rule when the rioting English populace proclaimed Mary their true and rightful sovereign. Despite her innocence, Jane was brutally executed at the age of sixteen.<br><br>Mary's reign was marked by her savage persecution of heretics (non-Catholics) and by the emotional turbulence of her marriage to King Philip II of Spain. Weir describes the mounting tensions of the final days of Mary's bloody reign, as the shrewd, politically adroit Elizabeth quietly positions herself to assume royal power. The Children of Henry VIII closes with Elizabeth's accession and the commencement of one of the longest, and most spectacularly successful, reigns in English history.<br><br>Deeply engrossing, written with grace and clarity, The Children of Henry VIII combines the best of history and biography. Weir's devoted readers will recognize this as her finest book yet.</p><p>The royal family may have its problems these days, but as Alison Weir reminds us in this cohesive and impeccably researched book, the nobility of old England could be both loveless and ruthless. Weir, an expert in the period and author of a book on Henry&#39;s VIII wives, focuses on the children of Henry VIII who reigned successively after his death in 1547: Edward VI, Mary I (&#34;Bloody Mary&#34;) and Elizabeth I. The three shared little--living in separate homes--except for a familial legacy of blood and terror. This is exciting history and fascinating reading about a family of mythic proportions.Alison Weir succeeds in doing what very few writers of history ever have -- she makes it live. Her unraveling of the intricate intrigues and power-plays that surrounded Henry's unfortunate children Mary, Elizabeth and Edward -- and his young heir Lady Jane Grey reads like a suspense novel. This is history as it should be written. <br>--Margaret Sanborn/Publicity</p><h2>The Middle Sea: A History of the Mediterranean</h2><p>A one-volume narrative history of the Mediterranean from Ancient Egypt to 1919. <br><br>This magnificent undertaking tackles a vast subject &#x2014; vast in time (from the oldest surviving pyramid to the First World War); vast in geography (from Gibraltar to Jerusalem); and vast in culture, including as it does the civilizations of the Phoenicians, the Ancient Egyptians, Greece, Carthage, Rome, Byzantium, as well as the Borgias and the Medicis, Mohammed and El Cid, Napoleon and Nelson, Moslems, Jews and Christians.<br><br><b>The Middle Sea</b> is not a dry record of facts; it is a rackety read about historical figures &#x2014; dissolute Popes and wily Emperors, noble-hearted Generals and beautiful Princesses. But the author&#x2019;s greatest strength is naval and military history: from the Crusades to the expulsion of the Moors from Spain; from Trafalgar to Gallipoli. Towns are besieged and sacked, Kingdoms are won and lost. The narrative covers the glories of Constantinople and Venice, and the stirring history of the islands of the Mediterranean &#x2014; Malta, Sicily, Crete and Cyprus.<br><br><b>The Middle Sea</b> is the culmination of John Julius Norwich&#x2019;s long and distinguished career as one of the greatest enthusiasts for anecdotal history, and the highways and byways of scholarship.</p><p>John Julius Norwich is the author of histories of Norman Sicily, of the Republic of Venice and of the Byzantine Empire. He has also written on architecture, music and the history plays of Shakespeare, and has presented some thirty historical documentaries on BBC television.<b>Chapter I</b><br><br><b>Beginnings</b><br>The Mediterranean is a miracle. Seeing it on the map for the millionth time, we tend to take it for granted; but if we try to look at it objectively we suddenly realise that here is something utterly unique, a body of water that might have been deliberately designed, like no other on the surface of the globe, as a cradle of cultures. Almost enclosed by its surrounding lands, it is saved from stagnation by the Straits of Gibraltar, those ancient Pillars of Hercules which protect it from the worst of the Atlantic storms and keep its waters fresh and &#x2013; at least until recent years &#x2013; unpolluted. It links three of the world's six continents; its climate for much of the year is among the most benevolent to be found anywhere.<br><br>Small wonder, then, that the Middle Sea should not only have nurtured three of the most dazzling civilisations of antiquity, and witnessed the birth or blossoming of three of our greatest religions; it also provided the principal means of communication. Roads in ancient times were virtually nonexistent; the only effective method of transport was by water, which had the added advantage of being able to support immense weights immovable by any other means. The art of navigation may have been still in its infancy, but early sailors were greatly assisted by the fact that throughout much of the eastern Mediterranean it was possible to sail from port to port without ever losing sight of land; even in the western, a moderately straight course was all that was necessary to ensure an arrival on some probably friendly coast before many days had passed.(1) To be sure, life at sea was never without its dangers. The <i>mistral </i>that screams down the Rh�ne valley and lashes the Gulf of Lyons to a frenzy, the <i>bora</i> in the Adriatic that can make it almost impossible for the people of Trieste to walk unassisted down the street, the <i>gregale</i> in the Ionian that has ruined many a winter cruise &#x2013; all these could spell death for the inexperienced or unwary. Even the mild <i>meltemi</i> in the Aegean, usually a blessing to ships under sail, can transform itself within an hour into a raging monster and drive them on to the rocks. True, there are no Atlantic hurricanes or Pacific typhoons, and for most of the time &#x2013; given a modicum of care &#x2013; the going is easy enough; still, there was no point in taking unnecessary risks, so the earliest Mediterranean seafarers kept their journeys as short as possible.<br><br>When possible, too, they kept to the northern shore. To most of us today, the map of the Mediterranean is so familiar that we can no longer look at it objectively. If, however, we were to see it for the first time, we should be struck by the contrast between the littorals to the north and south. That to the north is full of incident, with the Italian and Balkan peninsulas flanked by three seas &#x2013; Tyrrhenian, Adriatic and Aegean &#x2013; and then that extraordinary conformation of the extreme northeast corner, where the Dardanelles lead up to the little inland Sea of Marmara, from the eastern end of which the city of Istanbul commands the entrance to the Bosphorus and ultimately to the Black Sea. The southern coast, by contrast, is comparatively featureless, with few indentations; there one is always conscious, even in the major cities, that the desert is never far away.<br><br>One of the many unsolved questions of ancient history is why, after countless millennia of caveman existence, the first glimmerings of civilisation should have made their appearance in widely separated areas at much the same time. Around the Mediterranean that time is, very roughly, about 3000 BC. It is true that Byblos (the modern Jbeil, some fifteen miles north of Beirut), which gave its name to the Bible - the word actually means papyrus - was settled in palaeolithic times and is believed by many to be considerably older still; indeed, it may well be the oldest continuously inhabited site in the world. But the remains of a few one-room huts and a crude idol or two can hardly be considered civilisation, and there as elsewhere nothing much really happens until the coming of the Bronze Age at the beginning of the third millennium BC. Then at last things start to move. There are some extraordinary monolithic tombs in Malta dating from about this time, and others in Sicily and Sardinia, but of the people who built them we know next to nothing. The three great cultures that now emerge have their origins a good deal further east: in Egypt, Palestine and Crete.<br><br>Of the traditional Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, only the oldest, the Pyramids of Egypt, survives today; and there is little doubt that they will still be standing five thousand years hence. The most venerable of all, the step pyramid at Saqqara, is said to date from 2686 BC; the grandest and noblest, that of the Pharaoh Khufu &#x2013; known to Herodotus and so, normally, to us as Cheops &#x2013; from a century later. Their longevity should cause us no surprise; their shape alone is almost enough to confer immortality. No buildings in the world are less top&#x2013;heavy. Not even an earthquake could seriously shake them. Gazing up at them, one is dumbfounded by the sheer magnitude of the achievement, and of the underlying ambition: that a man, nearly five thousand years ago, should take it upon himself to build a mountain, and succeed in doing so. Only twenty&#x2013;five years later, Cheops&#x2019;s son Chefren built another, connected to a monumental hall of alabaster and red granite, along the walls of which were twenty&#x2013;three seated statues of himself. Finally, he commissioned the Sphinx. It may well be his portrait; it can certainly claim to be the oldest piece of monumental sculpture &#x2013; it is actually carved from an outcrop of rock &#x2013; known to man. <br><br>Egypt, having started so early, was always slow to change. Cheops and Chefren belonged to the Fourth Dynasty; of the first three we know nothing but the names of some of the rulers. The last dynasty was the Thirty-First, which ended in 335 bc with the conquest of the country by the Persians; three years later they in their turn were thrown out by Alexander the Great. Alexander did not linger - he never did - but marched on to Mesopotamia and the further east. After his death in 323 Egypt passed to his former general, Ptolemy, whose line, more Greek than Egyptian, continued for another three centuries. Thus, from the shadowy beginnings with the First Dynasty until the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC, there extended a period of more than three thousand years; yet the untutored eye, balefully staring at relief carvings on the walls of tombs or at endless columns of hieroglyphics, finds it hard to distinguish the art of one millennium from that of the next.<br><br>Nonetheless, a few other great names imprint themselves on the memory: Queen Hatshepsut (1490-69 BC), for example, who, though technically only regent for her stepson and nephew Thutmose III, completed the temple at Karnak - erecting two obelisks there to commemorate the fact - and decorated the awe-inspiring pink granite temple of Deir el-Bahri at Thebes, on the walls of which she is represented as a man; Thutmose himself, who on her death in 1469, in what seems to have been a paroxysm of vindictive spite, ordered every portrait of her to be defaced and every inscription bearing her name chiselled away, but who later extended the bounds of his kingdom to the upper reaches of the Euphrates and proved himself - by his talents as general, lawgiver, builder and patron of the arts - one of the greatest of the pharaohs; Amenhotep IV, better known as Akhnaton (1367-50 BC) - instantly recognisable by his long, narrow, pointed face, stooping body and huge thighs - a religious fanatic who forbade the worship of the Theban sun god Amon, instituting instead that of the solar disc Aton, its rays as depicted ending in tiny hands outstretched to bless (or curse); his son-in-law and second successor the boy king Tutankhamun (1347-39 BC), who reverted to the old religion but would be obscure enough today were it not for Howard Carter's discovery on 5 November 1922 of his tomb, the sarcophagus almost invisible beneath the higgledy-piggledy piles of golden treasure - treasure which is to this day the chief glory of the Cairo Museum; and Rameses II, the Great (1290-24 BC), the megalomaniac who erected statues of himself all over Egypt and Nubia and may well have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus - though scholars are still arguing about this, and will continue to do so for many years to come. Finally we must make special mention of Akhnaton's queen, Nefertiti, whose bust - found in the excavated studio of an ancient craftsman in her husband's capital of Tell-el-Amarna and now in Berlin - suggests that she was one of the most ravishingly beautiful women who ever lived.1 Neither the Greeks nor the Romans, nor even the greatest sculptors of the Italian Renaissance, were ever to portray her equal. If ancient Egypt had produced no other work of art than this, those three millennia would still have been worth while.<br><br>Another reason for the strange timelessness of Egypt is its astonishing geography. Seen from the air, it looks exactly like a map of itself: vast expanses of yellow, with a thin blue-green line snaking up from the south, and a narrow border of green along each side before the yellow takes over again. To Egypt, the Nile is like the sun: a necessity to continuing national life in a way that no other river could ever be, as essential as a breathing tube to a deep-sea diver. In such conditions there is little opportunity for change; outside Cairo, Alexandria and one or two of the larger towns, life in most of Egypt carries on very much as it always has. There are few greater travelling pleasures than to board the night sleeper from Cairo to Luxor, and to awake early the next morning to find oneself moving at about ten miles an hour along the riverbank, while just outside the train window, golden in the early sunlight, there passes scene after scene straight out of a Victorian child&#x2019;s geogra...</p><h2>Richard Scarry&#39;s Peasant Pig and the Terrible Dragon: With Lowly Worm the Jolly Jester!</h2><p><p>Richard Scarry&#x2019;s beloved Busylande meets the Middle Ages&#x2014;and the result is a delightful fractured fairy tale featuring knights on horseback, wandering minstrels, intrepid peasants, a beautiful princess, and a frightening dragon! </p><p>Come to Busylande, a very busy, happy kingdom&#x2014;until the terrible dragon kidnaps Princess Lily.

With the current focus on building and renovating houses, there's a great demand for hardware that is both beautiful and functional and that matches the particular design of the house, whether it is Victorian, Arts and Crafts, Art Deco, Contemporary, or another style. Hardware can change the entire look of a room; the fine details on doorknobs and cabinet handles can become the decorative springboard for every room in the home. Compared with the expense of demolition and reconstruction, changing the surface details--replacing the hardware--is a small investment. And if the original hardware is intact, it can serve as a guide to the age and history of a house. It's a part of our heritage.In the first-ever comprehensive book written about decorative hardware, Liz Gordon and Terri Hartman, the owner and the manager of Liz's Antique Hardware, the nation's foremost antique hardware store, delve into this rarely considered aspect of interior design. They reveal the history behind the most loved styles of hardware during the last few hundred years and show you how to fit these decorative, historical pieces of art into your own home. You'll see exquisite homes that incorporate antique and contemporary hinges, handles, knobs, and locks--and find an incredible variety of ways to express your personal style through American decorative hardware. </p></p><p>Liz Gordon has been an antiques dealer specializing in hardware for twenty years.

Capable of a tranquil harmony, a serene strength that could transfer itself to others, yet too easily wounded by the power of facts, he knew desolation, wanted responsibility, and was imbued with the search for forms, the desire to differentiate and describe them, and not only out of doors ("in the field"), where this often tormenting but sometimes gratifying and at its best triumphant activity was his profession.At the end of the working day, in the light-gray gabled wooden house at the edge of the mainly Indian settlement in the Far North of the other continent, which for some months had been serving him and his colleague Lauffer as both laboratory and dwelling, he slipped the protective covers on the microscopes and binoculars he had been using alternately and, his face still distorted by the frequent changes from short view to long view and back, passed through the episodic space created by the sunset light and the hovering woolly-white seeds of the dwarf poplars, an after-work corridor, as it were, to "his" beach.A clay platform so low that he could have jumped off. There began the immense realm of the glittering river, extending to the whole circle of the horizon, flooding the continental shelf from east to west and at the same time meandering northward and southward through the sparsely settled but to all intents and purposes uninhabited lowlands. Narrowed, because it was the dry season and the glaciers had stopped melting, behind first a broad bank of gravel and shale and then a muddy slope, the river at Sorger's feet sent long, light sea waves beating against the land.Another thing that made the valley look like a body of standing water was that it reached out to the horizon on all sides but that, because of the river's meanderings, the lines of the horizon were formed not by streams flowing from east to west but by dry land, by the banks of that bend in the river surmounted by dwarf poplars and the tops of primeval conifers, which, though in reality sparse and stunted, seemed from a distance to form serried files.True, this apparent lake, bounded on all sides by land that looked to be flat, flowed at a speed hard to estimate, silently and quite smoothly except for the bathtub-like lapping of the waves on the muddy beach--one might have said a foreign body, filling the entire plain, mirrored yellow by the sunset sky, perceptible at first glance only as wetness, dotted here and there with island specks and sandbanks, they too lying flat in the hazy evening air. Only the eddies that formed over unseen depressions in the sand-and-gravel riverbed, swiftly circling funnels in the otherwise metallic yellow surface, were not yellow but, because of their sharper angle to the sky, a remote daylight blue from within which, amid the almost silent flow, soft brooklike gurglings could be heard.Sorger was buoyed by the thought that the months he had spent observing this wilderness, learning (approximately) its forms and their genesis, had made it his own private domain. Destructive as they may have been (and still were) in the objective world, the forces that went to make up this landscape, in becoming present to him along with the great flowing water, its eddies and rapids, without mental effort, through the perceptive process alone, were transformed by their own laws into a benign inner force, which calmed him and gave him strength. He believed in his science, because it helped him to feel whatever place he was in; far from putting him off, his consciousness of standing on a flat beach while the opposite shore, miles away and scarcely visible through the islands, was slightly steeper, and of being able to attribute this strange asymmetry to the rotation of the earth, gave him the feeling that the planet earth was a civilized, homelike, intelligible place, a feeling that made his mind playful and his body resilient.This state of mind was also favored by the fleeting thought that while poplar seeds were drifting through the air, the pebbles on the riverbed were at the same time shifting unseen, rolling or slowly leaping over one another, enveloped in clouds of mud and propelled by waves deep below the surface which he could sense rather than infer. Wherever he was, Sorger tried to experience minute burlesque processes of this kind, which sometimes merely amused him but sometimes aroused him and filled his whole being.For some years--since he had been spending most of his time alone--he had felt the need to sense the place where he was at the moment: to know distances, apprehend angles of inclination; to gain some idea of the composition and stratification of the soil he was standingon, at least down to a certain depth; to supply himself, by measurement and delimitation, with spaces which were hardly more than "forms on paper" but which, for a short while at least, enabled him to construct himself and make himself invulnerable.Sorger needed nature, but not only in its "unspoiled" state; in big cities, for example, he was satisfied to gain awareness of scarcely perceptible asphalt-covered humps and hollows, gentle rises and falls in the pavement, of church floors or stone stairs, worn with the steps of the centuries; or, visiting an unknown high-rise building, to fancy himself passing vertically through all the floors from roof to basement, and, finally, to daydream its granite foundations--until, in the end, orientation and the breathing space (and hence self-confidence) indispensable to life engendered each other.He had the ability (not constant, to be sure, but sporadic and accidental, though his profession made the accident possible and gave it some constancy) to call upon those parts of the world to which he had become accustomed in his work for help, or merely to conjure them up for the entertainment of himself and others, with all their specifications, their degrees of longitude and latitude, their light and wind conditions, their planetary conjunctions, as eternally peaceful images, belonging to everyone and no one, and betokening events still to be imagined.In every new scene, which might at first sight seem surveyable in its uniformity or picturesque in its contrasts, but in either case intelligible, this moment of naive familiarity was followed, often definitively, by a bewildered sense, akin to a loss of balance, of once again confronting a mere stage set, and a familiar one at that, further intensified by a sense of guilt at being, here too, "out ofplace." In the course of time, it had therefore become a passion with Sorger, while enduring this first feeling of emptiness, to win back these quickly squandered places by observing and taking notes. Unable, because he had long been nowhere at home, to recapture his self within his own four walls after such touristic humiliations by regions of the earth, he saw each new place as his only hope; if he did not (often reluctantly) commit himself to it through hard work, there would be no refuge for him in the scenes of his past--but then with luck, in times of exhaustion, all his localities joined together, the particular, freshly conquered one with those that had gone before, and formed a dome encompassing heaven and earth, a sanctuary, which was not only private but also open to others.After his initial irritation with a nature too quick to promise itself and even quicker to withdraw, Sorger was obliged, on pain of losing himself, to immerse himself in it. He was obliged to take the environing world seriously in the least of its forms--a groove in the rock, a change of color in the mud, a windblown pile of sand at the foot of a plant--as seriously as only a child can do, in order to keep himself, who scarcely belonged anywhere, who was nowhere at home, together, for whom he had no idea; there were times when this cost him a furious effort at self-conquest.For whom was he keeping himself together? Sorger knew that in devoting himself to his science he was to some extent practicing a religion. It was his work that enabled him, time and again, to enter into relationships, to choose and be chosen. By whom? No matter, as long as he was choosable.Indeed, his study of the earth's forms, carried on without fanaticism but so intensely that little by little hegained awareness of his own form in the process, had thus far saved his soul by differentiating him from the Great Formlessness and its dangerous moods and caprices.And what of others? Thus far in his profession Sorger had done no work expressly useful to anyone, let alone benefiting a community; he had neither drilled for oil nor predicted an earthquake nor even contributed to a construction project by testing the solidity of the subsoil. But of one thing he was sure--without the effort he made to endure the strangeness of every region of the earth, to read the landscape with the available means and give an orderly account of his reading, he would not have been fit company for anyone.He did not believe in his science as a kind of nature religion; on the contrary, his always "measured" practice of his profession (in the eyes of the chaotic and often charmingly erratic Lauffer, Sorger's work was always "made to measure") was at the same time an exercise in trusting the world, for the measured quality of his technical manipulations but also his personal, everyday movements resided in his constant attempt at meditation, which sometimes made him fumble majestically about in such places as bathrooms, kitchens, and tool sheds. Sorger's faith was directed at nothing; when successful, it merely enabled him to participate in "its object" (a stone with a hole in it, or perhaps only a shoe on the table, or a thread on the lens of his microscope) and endowed him, who at such times was able, despite his frequent anguish, to feel like a real scientist, with humor. And then, caught up in a gentle vibration, he would simply look at his world more closely.At such times of selfless tenderness (in his fleeting moments of hope he thought himself a fool) Sorger was not godlike; he just knew, for a brief moment--but onethat could be perpetuated with the help of forms--what was good and beautiful.He longed, it is true, for a faith directed at something, though he could not conceive of a God; but in moments of distress he noticed that he positively thirsted--an automatic compulsion?--to <i>share</i> in the thought of God. (Sometimes he tried to be pious--he did not succeed; but then he was sure that "the gods" understood him.)Did he envy the unflagging believers, the hosts of the already saved? In any event, he was touched by their freedom from moods, their easy transitions between gravity and good cheer, their enduring, benevolent, <i>good</i> extroversion; often enough he himself was simply <i>not good</i>, and to this he could not resign himself; too often he greeted some new object with loquacious enthusiasm and almost immediately thereafter turned away from it in silent revulsion--instead of responding to it once and for all with overarching humor.Nevertheless, he could not hobnob with believers. He understood them, but he could not speak their language, because he had no language or because in his exceptional states of credulity he would have spoken a language foreign to them; in the "dark night of their faith," where there was no speaking in tongues, they could not have understood him.On the other hand, for all his conviction, Sorger never ceased to regard the linguistic formulas of his science as a hoax; the rites in which it apprehended the landscape, its conventions of description and nomenclature, its conception of time and space, struck him as dubious. Having to use a language that had grown out of the history of mankind to describe the different movements and formations of the earth still made his head swim, and often he found it quite impossible to take account of time alongwith the places he had set out to investigate. He suspected the possibility of an entirely different schema for representing the correlation between time and geological formations, and saw himself smiling craftily, as the over-turners of systems have always done (that had struck him in all their photographs), and he foisted his own little hoax on the world.And so Sorger, his thoughts made playful by his after-work elation, was able, while contemplating the yellow wilderness, to sense the desolation of a man who, without faith in the power of forms or rendered incapable of such faith by ignorance, might find himself, as in a nightmare, confronting this part of the world alone: his horror face to face with the Evil One at the irrevocable end of the world, unable to die of loneliness then and there--since there would no longer be a then and there--or even to be carried off by Satan--for even such names would have ceased to exist--but doomed to die of horror, for time, too, would have ceased to exist. The fluvial plain and the wide, flat sky over it suddenly looked to him like the two shells of an open bivalve, emanating the terrible, the poignantly voluptuous seduction of those who have died since the beginning of time.Involuntarily, wrenched away from his play, Sorger--as though he had been his own double, as though exposed for all time to whirling emptiness on his outcropping of clay, marl, and possibly gold dust--turned toward the civilized hinterland, where the bushy light-colored tails of watchdogs could be seen wagging in the shrubbery, where tufts of grass growing on the earthen roofs of Indian huts glittered, and where the "eternally other"--his name at the moment for his colleague Lauffer--in mud-caked high boots and characteristic multi-pocketed jacket, a sparkling magnifying glass hanging from his neck (hehad just come in from his fieldwork), was standing on the topmost wooden step outside the gabled house, his face and torso still in the sun, in the first perplexity of return to a place where he only happened to be living, for a time stiffly and awkwardly imitating Sorger's stance, like Sorger looking out over the great fluvial plain, smoking a cigarette--a strangely helpless figure, with the same pinched look on his face as the row of Indians lined up outside.The familiarity between these two friends expressed itself not in chumminess but in a politeness that was almost diffident. Subject as they were to moods, the outburst of moodiness that might occasionally have done them good was not possible. Though they were obliged to share their workroom, it was only at first that they felt in each other's way; in the bedroom as well--the house consisted only of those two rooms--each had his place without need of planning. A certain neighborliness was taken for granted, yet it seemed accidental when they did anything together; each went about his own affairs and even in the house each had his own itineraries. They didn't really eat together; one might be eating a regular meal; the other would sit down with him, and the first would issue an invitation: "Won't you have a glass of wine with me?" If one wanted music, the other wouldn't leave the room; he would stay, showing no express interest and gradually perhaps begin to listen, or even ask to have a piece repeated.Lauffer was a liar; Sorger, for all his impenetrable cal...</p><h2>Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins: Desert Oath</h2><p><b>The official prequel to the highly anticipated latest instalment in the Assassin&#x2019;s Creed video game series.&nbsp;</b><br><br><i><b>Before Assassin&#x2019;s Creed: Origins, there was an Oath</b>.</i><br> <br> Egypt, 70BC, a merciless killer stalks the land.

She is the author of Looking for History, The Heart That Bleeds, and Samba, and she was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1995. Raised in Mexico and the United States, she now makes her home in Mexico City.ONE<br><br> New York<br><br> One autumn day in 1969, before the start of the advanced class at the Merce Cunningham dance studio, Merce came over to me and said that there were two opportunities for teaching modern dance that he thought might interest me. One was in Caracas, with a group of dancers who were only just forming their own company, and the other was in Havana, where there was a government-funded school dedicated to modern dance.<br><br> My life in dance had been routine and predictable until then, if not exactly normal. In Mexico, my native country, I joined a modern dance company at the age of twelve. At sixteen I left my father's home and traveled to New York to live with my mother, who had moved here following her separation from my father. I kept on dancing. At first I took classes at the Martha Graham studio. In the world of modern dance the brilliant, temperamental Martha was the most revered choreographer. Starting in the 1930s, she had revolutionized not only dance but theater as well; her use of sets and costumes turned on its head every standard notion of what can be done and communicated on a stage. Her quest for a body language that reflected the deepest inner conflicts, and the way she used gestures and movements to stage great myths, centering them on the internal universe of a single woman--Medea, Joan of Arc, Eve, all of them ultimately Martha herself in any case--brought her admirers and disciples from all the arts. She was, moreover, the first creator of modern dance to devise a truly universal dance technique out of the movements she developed in her choreography. I had studied Graham technique in Mexico, and one of my reasons for moving to New York had been to train directly at the source, at Martha's studio on East Sixty-third Street.<br><br> By that time, in the mid-1960s, Martha was very old and more or less pickled in alcohol. She put in rare appearances at her own studio, interrupting even a class that one of her best dancers was teaching to hurl philosophical exhortations and wounding comments at us, mocking our lack of passion and our flabby muscles. One of my most terrifying memories is of a mute hiatus during a class when all of us stood frozen in some pose Martha had demanded while she moved through the room, pinching this dancer in a rage, giving that one a tongue-lashing. Pain was necessary for dance, she always said, and I think at that stage in her life she wanted to contribute to our training by guaranteeing that we would suffer. After a couple of years of this I felt the need for a less orthodox and oppressive atmosphere and switched to the Cunningham studio, partly because I admired Merce's work with all my heart and partly because, after Martha's, Merce's studio was the best known.<br><br> Elegant, alert, and unfailingly courteous, Merce Cunningham was an established artist at the forefront of the Manhattan avant-garde. Modern dance has always been an art of the few, and there are not many choreographers who, like Merce, can afford the luxury of a standing company, and fewer still who have a studio where they and their company can earn money and create a pool of future dancers by offering daily classes. Even so, the studio and the classes barely enabled Merce and his company members to get by. His audience was devoted but small, and during performances one sometimes heard boos and hisses from baffled spectators who hadn't imagined, when they purchased their tickets, that the dancers would not go en pointe and that the accompaniment would be not tuneful music but a series of sounds generally produced at random, either on traditional instruments like John Cage's delightful "prepared piano" or, more often, by means of electronic gadgets. That was the case in Winterbranch, a rather long dance with no stage light that was performed throughout to a very loud metallic screech--hard even for the dancers to take.<br><br> Friend, collaborator, and source of inspiration to artists like Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, lifelong companion and creative partner of the composer John Cage, Merce, always an innovator, always evolving, was respected even by his detractors for the clean harmony of his work, for the simple, lucid logic of the technique taught at his studio, and for the modest, unassuming way he had one day taken his leave of Martha's company, where he had been a principal dancer. Without any rhetorical fuss he left behind the obsession with passion and narrative that was characteristic of Martha and her disciples; the use of dramaturgy as the connecting thread of choreography; and rhythmic music that guided the dancers' movements like a tambourine leading a trained bear in a circus. Instead, he chose to pursue the meandering paths of abstraction, chance, and Zen philosophy.Yet his avant-garde experiments never interfered with the technical perfection and extraordinary refinement of his choreography. In his own way he was a classicist.<br><br> Those of us who left Martha's studio for Merce's were attracted by that Apollonian temperament, which demanded concentration and intensity but rejected drama. It was mainly women who came to his little studio on Third Avenue at Thirty-third Street to take beginning, intermediate, and advanced classes, and quite a few of us were in flight from Martha. Merce's courteous distance came as cool salve on a burn, though it too had its price. Merce sometimes taught a beginners' class that started at six p.m. He didn't say much but would correct the students very patiently, and several of the more advanced dancers, including some who were already members of the company, would take the six o'clock class in the hope that Merce would at least cast a glance at them. All of us saw him as a flame flickering in a dark chapel. We spoke his name as if it were written entirely in capital letters, and we laid siege to him with our eyes. In return, he almost never said a word to any of us.<br> The fleeting heyday of American dance was just beginning, and most of us who were to be found in the modern dance studios then, with who knows what tangle of secret dreams inside us, had to work as secretaries or waitresses (I was the latter) in order to pay for classes and our own spartan expenses. This meant that we came to class already tired. Merce's studio was a bare cave that stank of sweat and often lacked heat on the coldest winter days. Our motley layers of sweaters and sweatpants couldn't protect us from the cold. The concrete floor was covered with shabby black linoleum, and before class we would wrap tape around our feet in an effort to close up the alarming cracks that appeared on our bare soles as we spun across that adhesive surface. After class we rinsed off the sweat as best we could at the sink in the studio's tiny bathroom, then went home on the subway, sprawled in the seats to give our rebellious muscles some relief. All of this took its toll on our bodies, but we had no money for massages or therapies. As it was, David Vaughan, the brisk but softhearted Englishman who took our money at the front desk--and who is to this day the company's resident historian--more often than not gave us a stern look and a class ticket on credit. We went on ridiculous diets: a friend asked me privately one afternoon, with a blush, whether I thought constipation could have a significant effect on your weight; she'd been feeding on lettuce and broccoli for a week, had been constipated for five days, and had weighed herself on five scales but hadn't lost a pound on any of them. Generally, by about age thirty-five, dancers no longer have healthy feet or knees or much elasticity left in their tendons, ligaments, and joints. We were eighteen, twenty, twenty-five years old, and we were the oldest young people in the world: our time was already running out.<br><br> Men were so scarce in this world that choreographers fought over them even if their feet were as flat as pancakes and their shoulders looked as if they'd been left dangling from a hook at birth. They strolled into class with a self-sufficient air, while we women were fervent and eternal supplicants, forever hoping against hope, suicidal gamblers who--despite the mirror's daily confirmation that our insteps were too low, our hips too wide, our legs too short, our arms too long, and our backs too stiff--would nevertheless go off to class in search of the miracle that would fulfill all our desires. Look at me, say I'm beautiful, say I'm for you. Choose me. Let me dance in your company.<br><br> When Merce didn't teach the beginners' class himself, he was replaced by one of the younger members of his company. The intermediate class was passed around among more established members of the company, and when they were on tour, it was taught by other dancers, most of whom had performed with Merce at some point. Though the intermediate class seemed to hold little interest for him and he rarely taught it, on his way up to his small apartment over the dance studio he used to pause in the doorway for a few moments, one shoulder lightly resting against the frame, his long arms folded neatly against his torso, his long legs together, and his curly head--heavy and canine--tilted attentively to one side, watching us. I would watch him too out of the corner of my eye, and I liked to think that he was sending me some correction with his gaze, which I caught in midflight and obeyed. I liked even more to think that he was aware that I did.<br><br> It was after one of those classes that he approached me for the first time. Merce, then fifty years old, employed certain well-worn theatrical tricks that nevertheless worked their full effect on us. One consisted of deploying his immense courtesy to convey the impression that you were doing him a favor by listening to him; another was to speak so softly that you were forced to concentrate completely on his words. That afternoon he leaned toward me to murmur that if I agreed and it was convenient, I might want to start taking the advanced class (which he almost invariably taught himself). That encounter, which can't have lasted more than thirty seconds, was one of the heart-stopping moments of my life.<br> It would never have occurred to me that there might be anything better in life than dance. I suffered because it was my destiny to suffer: I was plagued, among other things, by crippling shyness, by a sense that I was superfluous in the world, by a feeling that my face and body were unacceptable, by insomnia, loneliness, and severe anxiety attacks that often kept me even from going to class. But I had no complaints at all about my life, which, seen from this distance, truly was marvelous.<br><br> My comrades in enchantment and I stood in line for three whole nights, one after the other, to buy cheap tickets for the standing-room section of the Metropolitan Opera House. (Someone always brought coffee and cookies for everyone in the line, and the spirit of solidarity was absolute.) For three nights running we watched Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn perform Kenneth MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet. We watched all three performances standing up but at the back of the orchestra section, at much closer range than we could otherwise have afforded. The memory of Nureyev falling to his knees in ecstasy to cover Fonteyn's skirt with kisses still takes my breath away. The Martha Graham company was at the height of its glory. In 1965, during a three-week season at the Mark Hellinger Theatre, we took in the entire repertory of that monstrous genius (again, standing behind the last row in the orchestra section). During those three weeks our state of exaltation was so great that we managed only with difficulty to eat or speak.<br><br> My romance with Merce began the following year. Several of us went to a performance in a small auditorium at Hunter College, and the sight of such pure, limpid dance, so free of sentimental baggage that it seemed to be performed by a flock of subtle, iridescent birds, convinced me immediately that I was in the presence of a true revolutionary. It wasn't long before I left Martha's studio.<br><br> New York City offered us much more than dance. We watched Japanese and Italian movies at the Thalia and alternative films at midnight at the Waverly or the Bleecker Street Cinema. We learned that if we arrived at the New York State Theater after the first intermission, the ushers would let us in to watch the rest of the New York City Ballet's program free, and thus we became familiar with a good part of George Balanchine's repertory. At the Apollo Theater we saw Wilson Pickett and James Brown; at the Fillmore East, Jefferson Airplane and Janis Joplin. We had a friend who worked as an usher and helped us sneak into Carnegie Hall, and we put together expert picnics in Central Park while waiting in line for free tickets to the performances there.<br><br> One day we heard that the revolution was in Brooklyn, and we went to the Academy of Music--again, we stood in line all afternoon, this time waiting for half-price tickets--to see the legendary Living Theatre, back in New York after a long exile in Europe. The actors took their clothes off and crawled naked all over the audience, which struck us as thrilling in the extreme. It was the period when the traditional divisions were beginning to blur between classical and modern dance, dance and the martial arts, dance and theater, improvisation and performance. Joe Chaikin and Jean-Claude van Itallie, Robert Wilson, and the actors at the Performing Garage were inventing revolutionary theatrical forms, and we were inventing a new form of dance.<br><br> I say "we" because though I was neither a choreographer nor a famous, outstanding, or even promising dancer, I too was part of this avant-garde, dancing here and there with choreographers who were getting their start. There was Margaret Jenkins, for example, a dancer who taught Merce's intermediate class when the company was on tour, and who was starting to create her own choreography: she'd book a performance at a theater in Queens or in a Staten Island gym and then ask several of us who took her class to rehearse with her.</p><h2>Into the Lair (Falcon Mercenary Group)</h2><p>Falcon Mercenary Group Book 2 It was supposed to be an easy mission.

Ms. Woolley lived in Truro, Massachusetts, until her death in 2005.</p>PreSchool-Grade 1 What a pleasure it is to welcome a new edition of Jane Thayer's charming book, first illustrated by Seymour Fleishman (Morrow, 1958). More than anything in the world, Petey, a puppy, wanted a boy for Christmas. Nothing else his mother suggested would do, and none of the other dogs would give him their boys. Dejected, Petey passes the Home for Boys where a lonely newcomer sits on the steps. Petey has found not one boy, but 50 boys full of love. McCue's puppy is a frisky, impish dog-pound special, closely resembling her Sebastian, the Super Sleuth of Mary Blount Christian's novels (Macmillan). However, where Sebastian is portrayed with scratchboard, Petey and friends are in naturalistic watercolors highlighted with crayon. The "Orphan's Home" of the earlier edition has become a Home for Boys; minor changes in the text are in keeping with evolving life styles; the interracial boys are in cords, blue jeans and sneakers. With updated text and illustrations, an old friend has a new personality, and Petey is virtually guaranteed another almost 40 years of popularity with the picture book crowd.Virginia Opocensky, Lincoln City Libraries, Nebr.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Duchess of Aquitaine: A Novel of Eleanor</h2><p><i>&nbsp;"Love is for peasants," Eleanor said.

The 160-page guide identifies Ten Critical Skills teachers need for engaging students in productive learning while managing their classrooms effectively. The book gives K-12 school teachers (and their administrators and coaches) concrete, transferable techniques for engaging students more effectively and for improving learning overall.<p>Based on the authors' 100-plus years of collective teaching experience and 1000's of workshops and seminars, this guide explores the Ten Critical Skills with examples, checklists, how-to's, self-tests, strategies, and other useful techniques for the first-time teacher or the seasoned educator. </p><p> Meant to be read in any order, the chapters weave true stories of teacher and student success through charts with examples, helpful suggestions, and illustrations of what each of the ten essential classroom management skills looks like and sounds like. </p><p> No matter whether the teacher is in a lab, a classroom, at a work bench, on a field trip, in any region of the country--these management skills apply wherever learning takes place, adds co-author Gary Forlini. The key to the success of the strategies [in Class Acts] is that they are immediate and do-able. Once aware of the elements of a certain skill, a teacher can apply it right away, the very next day. Most teachers already perform many of these skills, says author Annette Brinkman, but with varying degrees of effectiveness. What we do in this book is provide the tools for teachers to grow in very specific and measurable ways. Now they can chart their own progress at their own pace, focusing on the best practices that will produce the surest results for them. The skills and strategies outlined in Class Acts are integral parts of the authors' work in training administrators and teachers across the country. One of the authors' most popular workshops is their guided facilitation of administrators which trains principals, coaches, and mentors to recognize the essential skills for activating learning and to assist new and struggling teachers. Often, the authors work directly on-site with administrators as they observe, consult with, and coach teachers and apply these techniques for optimizing classroom management and student engagement. Annette summarizes the authors' work this way, We give administrators pragmatic, effective, and proven methods for growth-promoting leadership among all teachers, while giving teachers a framework (the top ten skills) and effective tools they can apply right away.

Centering around two young men--an unnamed narrator and his friend and former roommate, the Rat--these short works are powerful, at times surreal, stories of loneliness, obsession, and eroticism. Filled with all the hallmarks of Murakami's later books, they are a fascinating insight into a great author's beginnings, and remarkable works of fiction in their own right. In addition to the new translations, our edition also includes an exclusive essay by Murakami in which he explores and explains his decision to become a writer. Prequels to the much-beloved classics <i>A Wild Sheep Chase</i> and <i>Dance Dance Dance</i>, these early novellas are essential reading for Murakami lovers and contemporary fiction lovers, alike.</p><p>HARUKI MURAKAMI was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo. His work has been translated into more than fifty languages, and the most recent of his many international honors is the Jerusalem Prize, whose previous recipients include J. M. Coetzee, Milan Kundera, and V. S. Naipaul.

Nor are they only for hard-core Murakami fans. Despite plots that offer little more than a catalogue of bizarre events and random musings, there are enough flashes of brilliance to keep the reader interested. Signals that would become familiar in Mr. Murakami's fiction make an early appearance: characters alienated by society and afflicted by loneliness and ennui; quotidian detail that is, by turn, banal and fascinating; musical references; supernatural undertones; dark dreams and black humour. . . . Readers can be grateful. <i>Wind/Pinball </i>is a fresh, heart-warming dose of the Japanese master." &#x2014;<i>The Economist<br><br></i>"A pair of early literary excursions that are never less than insightful and intelligent; brisk and diverting; unusual and transporting; and that offer a fascinating insight into the imagination of a young writer who would go on, as it is phrased at the beginning of <i>Hear the Wind Sing</i>, to 'tell the story of the world in words far more beautiful than these.'" &#x2014;<i>The National (UAE)</i><br><br>"<i>Wind/Pinball </i>is a must-have for Murakami fans who want to know how he evolved and who might want to begin re-reading his work chronologically.

Those who are old enough cannot forget the misdeeds of Imriel's mother, Melisande, whose self-serving lies plunged their country into war. <br>In order to quell the uprising, Queen Ysandre hands down a decree: she will not divide the lovers, but neither will she acknowledge them.

The people are in an uproar and divided in support for the lovers; far too many recall the treasonous betrayals of Imriel&#x2019;s mother that ignited a long, bloody war and claimed the lives of thousands of d&#x2019;Angelines. Ysandre will not acknowledge the affair, and if the couple marries without her blessing, Sidonie will lose her claim to the throne. Imriel knows that only an impossible act of faith on his part will satisfy the demands of Blessed Elua, the queen, and the people of the realm. For love of Sidonie and country, then, he pledges to find his mother and bring her back to execution. But there are foreigners who command powerful dark magic and want Sidonie and the throne themselves. On Longest Night, they loose that magic, plunging the d&#x2019;Angelines into forgetfulness and insanity. Imriel must come to himself to rescue Sidonie from the invader and prevent the country from destroying itself. Carey has wowed us throughout the second Kushiel trilogy, which this book sensationally concludes, leaving faithful readers feeling both deliciously sated and hungry for more from her. --Paula Luedtke</p><h2>Notes of a Baseball Dreamer: A Memoir</h2><p>The author describes growing up baseball-obsessed in the Bronx, describing how the sport has dramatically influenced his life and the lives of other devoted fans.</p><p>Robert Mayer is the author of eight previous books, including THE DREAMS OF ADA and I, JFK.

Born and raised in New York, he now makes his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.First<br>A Puddle of Moral Uncertainty<br><br>When i was a kid my mother called me a skinny-marink. I never knew what <br>a marink was, not then, not now, but skinny I certainly was, largely because <br>whenever the Brooklyn Dodgers lost a baseball game I became too upset to <br>eat. And the Dodgers lost a lot. Baseball, by the time I was seven, had <br>lodged itself that deeply into my gut. My own national tapeworm. The <br>Dodgers lost just often enough to keep my immigrant parents fearing for my <br>survival. Such mounds of spaghetti and Yankee Doodles they did induce <br>down my gullet I quickly burned off by playing ball from the moment school <br>let out till half an hour past the time you could see the ball in your hand. <br>There was a decided advantage to playing ball after dark: errors could be <br>blamed on God, who"d been dumb enough to invent the useless night.<br> Strictly speaking, it wasn"t baseball we played. I grew up in the <br>Bronx, in a neighborhood of brick houses and tenements and narrow paved <br>streets lined on both sides with parked cars. We played punchball in a <br>concrete backyard; we played stickball in the street when the steady <br>stream of traffic would allow. But as Humpty Dumpty would surely have <br>instructed Alice, baseball we wanted it to be, so baseball it became, and <br>anyone who says different is a liar. The fact that we used our fists or <br>broomsticks instead of bats, that we hit Spaldeens or worn tennis balls <br>instead of baseballs, never detracted from my certainty that one day I would <br>be playing in the major leagues. I would be the next PeeWee Reese.<br> Though we lived a mile from Yankee Stadium, I seem to have <br>emerged from the womb a Dodger fan. This was just as well, because the <br>Yankees in that Joe-DiMaggio-followed-by-Mickey-Mantle era never seemed <br>to lose; as a Yankee fan I might have become the Goodyear blimp. But <br>rooting for the Yankees would have been like rooting for General Motors. I <br>was congenitally for the underdog, an off-my-trolley Dodger. As was my <br>older brother for reasons equally obscure.<br> All my friends on the block were Yankee fans, and my infatuation <br>with the Brooklyn Bums provided all the sweet music of childhood: the <br>endless front-stoop arguments over who was better, Reese or Rizzuto, <br>Mantle or Snider or Mays; all the grand clich�s that got us through the <br>wonder years, the true wonder years &#x2014; the days when girls were that half <br>of the human race who tried to throw a ball with the wrong foot in front. That <br>and nothing more.<br> My earliest baseball memory is from the summer of "46, late at <br>night, the Dodgers playing a night game against St. Louis, whom they were <br>battling for the pennant that year. My parents and my brother were asleep, <br>me in my bed, seven years old, the blanket pulled over my head to hide the <br>beam of a flashlight and the sound of a portable radio, listening to the <br>game.<br> The Dodgers and the Cardinals tied for the pennant that year. <br>They played the first playoff games in baseball history, best two out of <br>three. The Dodgers lost. Born to an ancient tribe of sufferers, I had found my <br>baseball home. The next year, sparked by Jackie Robinson, the Dodgers <br>would win the pennant but lose the World Series to the hated Yankees in <br>the seventh game. "THE BUMS IS DEAD," the Daily News would proclaim <br>while my weight dropped precariously. They would lose the series to the <br>Yankees again in "49. In 1950 they would fail to tie the Phillies for the <br>pennant on the final day of the regular season, when Richie Ashburn would <br>throw out Cal Abrams at home plate. I was eleven years old then, and I still <br>remember the name of the coach who sent Abrams in from third: Milton <br>Stock. Mentioned prominently, I believe, in Dante"s Inferno. . . .<br> And then came 1951.<br> Of 1951 we do not speak. . . .<br> Through all of this we played our own games, countless boy <br>hours &#x2014; punchball, stickball, boxball, triangle. Punchball we played in the <br>large backyard behind the houses our families rented. One side of the yard <br>was formed by the windowless rear wall of a solid brick warehouse. Another <br>side was the solid brick wall of a tenement. Two sides were formed by the <br>backs of brick houses, and these had windows in them. These windows, if <br>left open, often caught our Spaldeens or tennis balls; we would have to beg <br>to get them back; if left closed, when ball met glass &#x2014; a law of elementary <br>physics &#x2014; the glass often broke. Mostly this happened to the bedroom <br>window of Mrs. Newman, a frumpy hausfrau who would come waddling <br>down to the backyard to catch us, swinging a broom with which she hoped to <br>box our ears. But there were two sloping cement driveways leading down to <br>the yard, one at either end, and whichever Mrs. Newman chose to block with <br>her huge bulk, we could always scamper up the other. The poor woman never <br>understood Newton"s third law of punchball dynamics: that a two-hundred-<br>pound landlady in house slippers will never outrun a fifty-pound skinny-<br>marink. Not ever.<br> Though I liked to be called Pee Wee, my nickname for one entire <br>year was Slugger. That was because I was the only one on the block who <br>couldn"t punch the ball over the fence. But if there was derision in the name, <br>it was ill conceived. I had no desire to hit home runs; I was more the <br>hit-and-run type, the slickest fielder in high-tops. Pathologically shy in <br>school, on the ball field I was always the captain, shouting instructions to <br>kids much older than I.<br> My mother, who did the New York Times crossword puzzle every <br>day, was a firm believer in reading, and every two weeks we rode the trolley <br>car together to the Fordham library. And every two weeks, to her chagrin, I <br>came home with an armload of books about baseball. Fiction was <br>dominated by the immortal John R. Tunis; the clackety-clackety-clack of <br>spikes in The Kid from Tompkinsville and World Series was &#x2014; since we <br>ourselves played all our games in black high-top sneakers &#x2014; like music from <br>a foreign land. It was echoed in my childhood only by the clackety-clack of <br>the trolley cars as they switched rails on the way to Fordham Road and the <br>Grand Concourse, the Times Square of the Bronx. In the nonfiction section of <br>the library I read every book available about how to play baseball. I studied as <br>scrupulously as a brash young scientist at work. I knew the game. By the <br>time I was eight, I knew that on a hit to right field the shortstop had to cover <br>second base, while on a hit to left field he had to go out for the relay. I knew <br>that with a runner stealing and a left-hander at bat, he had to cover second. I <br>knew that to sacrifice a runner, you squared around and caught the ball on <br>the bat while laying down the bunt. And that bunting for a base hit was <br>another matter entirely; hour after hour in the small front parlor of our <br>apartment, where I slept, I stood with a bat in my hands and practiced <br>dropping it on an imaginary ball, laying the ball down the third base line even <br>as I broke toward first. I knew, therefore, nearly everything important about <br>life. The only thing I didn"t know was how to stop being afraid of the dark.<br> When I was six years old, one Saturday afternoon my brother <br>took me to see my very first movie, at the old Surrey Theater on Mount <br>Eden Avenue, fourteen cents for kids. The attraction was an animated Walt <br>Disney film called Make Mine Music. It featured, as I recall, The Little Engine <br>That Could, a bunch of penguins freezing their butts off on ice floes, and <br>assorted other inspirations and amusements. Unbeknownst to me, however, <br>there was also a second feature, which my brother wanted to see: The <br>Phantom of the Opera, with Lon Chaney. As we watched the film, I took <br>particular note of the Phantom"s acid-eaten face. I did not venture into a dark <br>movie theater again for two more years. I did not go to bed with the light off in <br>my room for three.<br> "How can you be a baseball player if you"re afraid of the dark?" my <br>frustrated mother asked, trying a bit of psychology.<br> "What"s that got to do with anything?"<br> "How will you play night games?"<br> "There"s lights."<br> The trouble was, even if the naked light bulb was burning on the <br>ceiling of your room, when you closed your eyes to go to sleep, darkness <br>inevitably descended. To rid myself of the monsters that immediately filled <br>my brain, I began to chant, that summer of 1947, the first full summer of my <br>fandom, the same refrain, over and over in my brain: The Dodgers are gonna <br>win the pennant! The Dodgers are gonna win the pennant! The Dodgers are <br>gonna win the pennant! Since I had never in my life seen a sheep, counting <br>Jackie Robinsons and Pee Wee Reeses scoring runs was far superior to <br>the traditional escape. The problem was, the Dodgers actually did win the <br>pennant that year, so when October turned to November and then to winter, <br>the mantra of the Dodgers" winning lost some of its soporific effect. Which <br>gave new meaning to the perennial Brooklyn refrain, "Wait till next year."<br> If the Dodgers did win the pennant that year, they maintained their <br>traditional role as heartbreakers by losing the World Series to the hated <br>Yankees. It was during that series that I learned an important lesson, <br>however. While Dodger fans could run like hell, Yankee fans could fly.<br> It was the fourth game of the Series, played at Ebbets Field. The <br>Yankees led, two games to one. Now, in game four, Bill Bevens of the <br>Yankees was pitching a no-hitter with two out in the ninth inning. To be <br>no-hit in the World Series &#x2014; that would be too much for even a Dodger fan to <br>bear. I was listening in our two-family house, in our apartment that covered <br>the entire first floor, when two men reached base on walks and Cookie <br>Lavagetto came up to pinch-hit. The Yankees were ahead, 2&#x2013;1. Lavagetto <br>swung. The ball sailed deep into right field &#x2014; all this coming over a yellow <br>plastic radio in the moderately hoarse voice of Red Barber, the voice of the <br>Bums, the original music man of my youth. The ball hit the wall high over the <br>right fielder"s head. Two Dodgers raced around the bases and scored. The no-<br>hitter was broken, the Dodgers had won the game and evened the Series, <br>all with that one swing, the most dramatic hit in history up to that time &#x2014; <br>and, for Dodger fans, for all time to come. (We do not mention 1951.) This <br>little-known substitute player, Cookie Lavagetto, who would never play <br>another season, had found instant immortality &#x2014; this player who until then <br>might have been to the vast uncaring public, or to my parents, some arcane <br>vegetable, like a zucchini or a squash. You don"t get any dessert till you <br>finish your lavagetto.<br> Lightheaded with joy, I raced out the door and down the three front <br>steps to rub it in to my neighbor and best friend, Jackie Brownstein. He <br>lived two doors away and was a Yankee fan, antagonist in all my childhood <br>arguments, William Buckley to my Bill Moyers. To my eternal <br>astonishment Jackie, who lived on the second floor and thus had to churn his <br>solid body down a whole flight of stairs, Jackie, who should have been <br>brooding in solitude about the sudden turnabout, as I would have been doing <br>had our roles been reversed, Jackie was waiting for me in the street before I <br>got there, waiting to chatter excitedly about the unbelievable ending. As if he <br>knew his Yankees would triumph anyway. As they did. As in those days <br>they always did. But how had he gotten into the street so fast? How had he <br>beaten me, for I had raced to the door in a .ash? There could be only one <br>explanation: he had leapt without fear from his upstairs parlor window. <br>Yankee fans, it seemed, could fly.<br> This observation has held up fairly well throughout my life. In the <br>byways of my mind, Dodger fans and Giant fans and now Mets fans tend to <br>ride the buses or hitch with their thumbs, hoboes drinking beer at synaptic <br>gaps. While Yankee fans drink Chivas Regal and fly first class, no matter <br>how well or how badly their team is doing. They need the wider seats for <br>their mental bottoms. They do not suffer, they do not quit eating, when the <br>Bronx Bombers lose. They are not now, nor have they ever been, either <br>skinny or marinks.<br> A day or two after Lavagetto"s Hit came Gionfriddo"s Catch.With <br>two men on base and the Dodgers leading, 8&#x2013;5, Joe DiMaggio belted a long <br>drive into left-center field. A Dodger scrubbini named Al Gionfriddo, filling in <br>in left field, raced far back to the wall and caught the ball as it passed over <br>the low fence into the left field bullpen. Television had not yet reached <br>Townsend Avenue in 1947, so this, too, I heard on the radio. A picture of the <br>catch appeared in the next day"s newspapers &#x2014; and has been reprinted <br>many times since. It shows Gionfriddo with his arm bent at his waist, over <br>the bullpen fence, the ball in his glove. I studied the picture that day and have <br>studied it many times since and still can"t figure out if this was the follow-<br>through of a traditional leaping catch or if, indeed, he caught the ball in that <br>curious position. It remains one of the abiding mysteries of life, along with <br>the origin of the universe and how anyone can eat boiled okra.<br> Despite the immortal heroics of Lavagetto and Gionfriddo, <br>however, the Dodgers lost this Subway Series, this first World Series in <br>which I was an active participant. On the seventh day God rested; He <br>ceased His miracles; He let the Philistines win. On the afternoon of the <br>seventh game, I was riding downtown with my parents in the family car, going <br>I know not where, when I heard the tragic ending on the car radio. Minutes <br>later we passed through Times Square, thick with traffic and noisy people in <br>the streets, as the electric lights on the Times Tower spelled out the Yankee <br>victory. People were shouting and cheering and throwing confetti, and I, <br>feeling sick to my stomach, could not imagine what they were celebrating. <br>Didn"t they understand that the Dodgers had lost?<br> The next day my friend Jackie"s father, Harry Brownstein, who <br>was a policeman and a Yankee fan and had heavy jowls, came by our <br>house and handed me a small white card rimmed all around in black. In tiny <br>letters in the center, surrounded by white space, were the words BROOKLYN <br>DODGERS.<br> I didn"t get it. I asked my mother what the card meant. She <br>explained that it was the kind of card people handed out when someone <br>had died: it had a black border with the dead person"s name in the middle.<br> I didn"t think it was very funny.<br> I still don"t.<br><br>He no longer lives in the city that gave him birth, the city that gave him <br>succor, an education, a job.

But as Erik Davis explains, religious impulses and magical dreams permeate the history of technology, and especially information technology. Ranging from the printing press to the telegraph, from radio to the Internet, Davis peels away the utilitarian shell of technology to reveal the mystical and millennialist fervor that attends each new communications breakthrough.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>As he unveils the hidden history of technomysticism, Davis shows how the religious imagination continues to feed the utopian dreams, apocalyptic visions, digital phantasms, and alien obsessions that populate today's technological unconscious. From shamanism to alchemy, evangelism to Buddhism, <b>TechGnosis</b> probes our virtual future through the visionary lenses of the past. In these pages, Davis offers a lucid, playful, and astonishingly erudite journey through our hyper-mediated environment. Anyone grappling with the morphing boundaries and terminal speed of our present moment will want to take the ride.</p><p>The gap between the technological mentality and the mystical outlook may not be as great as it seems. Erik Davis looks at modern information technology--and much previous technology--to reveal how much of it has roots in spiritual attitudes. Furthermore, he explores how those who embrace each new technological advance often do so with designs and expectations stemming from religious sensibilities. In doing so, Davis both compares and contrasts the scientific attitude that we can know reality technologically and the Gnostic idea of developing ultimate understanding. Although organized into reasonable chapters, there's a strong stream-of-consciousness component to Davis's writing. His expositions may run, for example, from information theory to the nebulous nature of Gnosticism to the philosophical problem of evil-�all in just a few pages. It's as if there are so many connections to make that Davis's prose has to run back and forth across time and space drawing the lines. But the result, rather than being chaotic, is a lively interplay of wide-ranging ideas. His style is equally lively and generally engaging--if sometimes straying into the hip. In the end, he succeeds in showing the spiritual side of what some may see as cold, technological thought. <i>--Elizabeth Lewis</i>Praise for TechGnosis<br><br>"TechGnosis is a tour de force of scholarship, insight, and juicy writing. Like McLuhan, Erik Davis sheds light on the shadows--the places we've neglected to look, or have feared to look, in our search for the meaning of human inventions."<br>--Howard Rheingold, author of The Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier<br><br>"TechGnosis is at once an EEG of our silicon unconscious and a recovered memory of sacred technologies. Erudite but wired to the eyeballs, Davis is that rare blend: a postmodern classicist, equally at home with ancient automata and alien autopsies. A true believer in the politics of myth, he is mindful, nonetheless, of the social issues that haunt our techno-eschatologies. Erik Davis is the perfect tour guide to our Disneyland of the Gods."<br>--Mark Dery, author of Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century and editor of Flame Wars<br><br>"Erik Davis has written one of the best media studies books ever published. There's never been a more lucid analysis of the goofy, muddled, superstition-riddled human mind, struggling to come to terms with high technology. Unlike most tomes about tech, the occult, and social theory, TechGnosis is literate, accessible, and funny. A real winner all around!"<br>--Bruce Sterling, author of The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier<br><br>"TechGnosis is a delirious and exhilarating exploration of the metascapes of new mind and new nature. Pungent and profound, the writing is pure alchemy, and the reader is redesigned in the very act of reading. This is perhaps the best book written on where we are going and how we got there."<br>--Jean Houston, author of A Mythic Life<br><br>"Erik Davis is an astute guide through the heavens and hells where cyber-reality, pop culture, and spiritual impulses arm wrestle each other for dominance. TechGnosis is a fascinating book that rewards the reader with an uncommon number of surprises and insights."<br>--Jay Kinney, editor-in-chief, Gnosis magazine<br><br>"Erik Davis's compendious recitation of the history of communications technology dominates the discursive landscape of techno-exegesis like a Martian war machine.

But if Tully gives friendship and loyalty, she gives them for good, and she forms an enduring bond with Jennifer and Julie, schoolfriends from very different backgrounds. As they grow into the world of the seventies and eighties, the lives of the three best friends are changed forever by two young men, Robin and Jack, and a tragedy which engulfs them all. Against the odds, Tully emerges into young womanhood, marriage and a career. At last Tully Makker has life under control. And then life striles back in the most unexpected way of all...</p><p>Paullina Simons was born in Leningrad in 1963. As a child she emigrated to Queens, New York, and attended colleges in Long Island. Then she moved to England and attended Essex University, before returning to America. She lives in New York with her husband and children.Esteemed editor Bob Wyatt's initial book for his new imprint, this much ballyhooed first novel is not notable for literary merit but for the melodramatic story it tells. Set during the last two decades in Topeka, Kans., and centering on a tough kid named Tully who oddly resembles skater Tonya Harding in looks and deportment, the narrative chronicles Tully's wild struggle against her lower-class origins, circumstances and fate (not to mention her genes) without any redeeming growth or insights achieved by any of the central characters until at the end Tully belatedly realizes the error of her ways. It's an emotionally crude coming-of-age story in which Tully, her two best girlfriends and the two men she loves never seem to rise above adolescent emotions and behavior. The story has the no-holds-barred, cranked-out quality of 19th-century penny novels, with an abundance of cheap thrills and hair-raising scenes. We tag along as Tully endures abandonment, incest, abortion, child and spousal abuse, passion, promiscuity, marriage, motherhood, infidelity, terrible nightmares, midnight graveyard scenes, tortured partings with lovers and more. The most interesting character is the villain, Hedda Makker, Tully's mother, whose chief pleasure in life is beating the living daylights out of Tully. Though billed as "a big Russian novel" about mothers and daughters, much of the narrative has a breathless, awkward oral texture, although long patches of exposition have an evenness and clarity that suggest Simons's potential. Despite all the wailing, sighing and bloodletting--or perhaps because of it--the story is engrossing as tabloid features often are: not believeable or artful, but fascinating in a macabre way. 165,000 first printing; $150,000 ad/promo; BOMC selection . <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Natural Right and Political Philosophy: Essays in Honor of Catherine Zuckert and Michael Zuckert</h2><p><p>Inspired by the work of prominent University of Notre Dame political philosophers Catherine Zuckert and Michael Zuckert, this volume of essays explores the concept of natural right in the history of political philosophy. The central organizing principle of the collection is the examination of the idea of natural justice, identified in the classical period with natural right and in modernity with the concept of individual natural rights. &nbsp; Contributors examine the concept of natural right and rights in all the manifold and interdisciplinary dimensions associated with the Zuckerts&#x2019; oeuvre. Part I explores the theme of natural right in the ancient and medieval political philosophy of Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, and St. Augustine. Part II examines the early modern break from the classical tradition in the work of Montaigne, Spinoza, Montesquieu, Locke, and Hegel as well as the legacy of the modern natural rights tradition as explored by Leo Strauss and Pope John Paul II. Part III treats the theme of natural rights from the Puritans through the Founding period in such figures as Thomas Jefferson and Gouverneur Morris and up to the Progressive era with Booker T. Washington and Theodore Roosevelt. Part IV addresses questions of natural justice in literature, including works of Euripides, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Edith Wharton, and Tom Stoppard.</p> <p>"In this collection compiled in honor of Catherine and Michael Zuckert, the contributors address a wonderful variety of serious issues in important literary and philosophic texts.

At the close of the 1970s, the Rovners, the Wasserstroms, and the Wills-Silvermans will have to shed their pasts to cross into that new, shining decade of hope: the 80s.</p><p>Adam Langer has worked extensively as a print journalist, film producer, and playwright, and has been featured on NPR, CNN <i>Headline News</i>, <i>Fox News</i>, and E! Entertainment Television. Langer is a former senior editor of <i>Book</i> magazine and a recipient of a National Arts Journalism Fellowship at Columbia University.If you're the sort of reader who flips to the final pages of a book to see how it ends, you'll find inside Adam Langer's first novel, Crossing California, not the ending but rather a 12-page glossary with entries such as "The Blues Brothers," "Cheap Trick," "Richard J. Daley," "honky" and "yarmulke." As with the novel itself, Langer occasionally uses this glossary to provide an anthropologist's peek at a neighborhood (Chicago's predominantly Jewish Rogers Park) during a specific period (the 444 days that American hostages were held in Iran). Therefore, you would learn not only who Ayatollah Khomeini is but also that Astroturf is "A form of synthetic grass popular on front porches of Chicago houses in the 1970s."<p>Adopting a quasi-omniscient point-of-view to tell this multi-generational saga of three families whose paths intersect, Langer, former editor of the now-defunct Book Magazine, dips into more characters' lives than you're likely to find in several contemporary novels combined. We meet the Wasserstroms: Jill, an introspective eighth-grade Hebrew School student who, on the precipice of adolescence, wants to stake out territory not already tainted by her older and wilder sister, Michelle. We also meet Charlie, their sad-sack but well-meaning father, who is the short-lived manager of It's In the Pot! restaurant. Less endearing are the Rovners, beginning with Lana, a scheming and deceitful 12-year-old; Larry, her older, scheming, sex-obsessed brother and founding member of Rovner!, a rock band celebrating being Jewish; Michael, the scheming, sex-obsessed and unhappily married father; and Ellen, the unhappily married mother, a clinical psychologist who doesn't apply to her own situation the advice she offers other unhappily married women.</p><p>Finally, there's eighth-grader Muley Wills, the biracial son of Carl Silverman, a seedy record-label mogul; and Deirdre Wills, daughter of an African American blues singer, who is raising Muley by herself. Saving money so that his mother, a housekeeper, can complete her long-abandoned college degree, Muley is constantly coming up with ideas on how to turn a buck, including putting together a radio-show audition tape in which he tells listeners the story of Russian defector Peachy Moskowitz, a made-up character who supposedly teaches Muley a series of life lessons.</p><p>Muley is a "likable likable" character -- that is, a person whose company you'd like to keep in real life as well as on the page. While we meet a few "unlikable likable" characters -- those you wouldn't care for in person but who are endearing on the page -- the novel is chock-full of "unlikable unlikables," characters who probably wouldn't earn your sympathy in either life or fiction. </p><p>Weighing in at a dense 432 pages, with themes of race and class looming overhead, Crossing California is an ambitious book with Dickensian scope, but it is also the most recent entry in what may become a new genre: the dysfunctional family saga as seen through the eyes of a Gen X author. The dominant trait of such a book is the author's inability to move aside and let his characters breathe. Instead of being engrossed in Langer's characters' lives, I am too often distracted by his presence and that of his fiction writer's toolbox. The result is a novel that, for all its potential warmth, is oddly chilly.</p><p>Langer's convenient shifts in point-of-view, sometimes in mid-paragraph, and his love of superfluous micro-observations contribute to the distance one feels toward his characters, but his most frustrating trait is dryly summarizing the vast majority of the novel's action, including most of what should be dialogue. Consider this robotic exchange between Carl and Deirdre, ex-spouses who haven't spoken to each other in more than 12 years, an encounter that yells for dramatic immediacy: "Carl . . . said he was in town and he wanted to see Muley; he had to talk to him. Deirdre said he had to be out of his mind. They had come to an agreement a dozen years ago, and unless she had missed something, Muley was not an adult yet, she was his mother and, she added, his legal guardian, and she had long ago decided that his father would not be playing an active role in his life, or in hers. Carl said yes, he 'dug' that, but this was different, because he had heard from Muley; that's why he was in town." </p><p>Reading Crossing California, you get the feeling Langer didn't make many artistic decisions about what might best serve his characters. This is really unfortunate. The novel's themes prove that he is a writer with a large vision, but all too often Crossing California tries to be a big novel rather than simply being one.</p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

This fact lies outside of the typical activist's perspective and doesn't fit into society's dominant anthropocentric worldview. When it comes to our use of natural resources, we are taught to consider issues related to consumption such as energy efficiency and recycling. However, the number of people - and how fast that number is growing - is a more important factor. More people consume more resources, need more services, produce more waste, and create more world conflict as resources diminish.<br>Working on downstream issues, such as saving the environment, feeding the hungry, and ending homelessness, is noble but ineffective and inefficient without also working to solve the primary cause of these and other important issues. In <i>Move Upstream: A Call to Solve Overpopulation</i>, Karen Shragg challenges social and environmental activists to stop working downstream and take the problem of overpopulation seriously.

She was leaning out over the edge, reaching down into a deep pool of still water. Swirls of river foam clung to the bottom of her rolled-up sleeves and the floating ends of her long red hair. She was watching something in the dark river-shadows.<br> <br>Rob and Euan pulled up beside me by the gap in the trees, their bike tires skidding on the muddy track.<br> <br>&#x201c;What you looking at, Callum?&#x201d; said Rob.<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s down there,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>Euan pushed away a pine branch to get a better view down to the river. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dunno,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s nuts though. It must be freezing in there.&#x201d; I looked up and down the river to see if she was with anyone, but there was no one. She was on her own.<br> <br>The river was fast and swollen from the heavy rains. It came down from the loch in the high glen above us. Late March snow still clung to the mountain gullies.

Spanning the centuries from Native American and Viking maritime activities before Columbus through today&#39;s maritime enterprise, the text provides a new history of the U.S. from the fundamental perspective of the sea that surrounds it and the rivers and lakes that link its vast interior to the seacoast. America and the Sea has been gracefully written by six prominent maritime-history scholars whose individual areas of research and teaching range from labor to technology, from the fisheries to the U.S. Navy. Their text incorporates considerations of art, literature and poetry along with discussions of the economic, political, diplomatic and technological foundations of American maritime history.</p><p>John B.

The author lives in Boston, MA.A collaborative history of the profound influence of the sea on America's identity and its national imagination. The six authors (including William Fowler Jr., Andrew German, John Hattendorf, Jefrey Safford, and Edward Sloan, in addition to Labaree), all historians associated with the Munson Institute at Mystic Seaport, trace both the development of distinctive American industries dependent on the seafisheries, boat building, merchant serviceas well as the emergence, over the course of two centuries, of the US Navy, culminating with WWII, when the country fielded both the largest navy and the largest merchant marine service the world had ever witnessed. A considerable amount of material on the impact of a sea-based economy on the rise of eastern and western cities, and on the influence of the sea on American society, carries the narrative far beyond the precincts of economic history. There's also an astute summary of three centuries of marine art in America, and a survey of the presence of the sea in American literature and folklore. Some 300 illustrations further enliven the text. A model of popular scholarship, and clearly the definitive work on the subject.

BOMC Main.</p><p>The "best" short stories seems an oddly cliquish categorization for any treasury of African American writing, if only because black authors have long expressed displeasure at their own exclusion from the canon. Yet this superb collection lives up to its billing; the 37 stories unabashedly depict the great diversity of black life. Compiled by Naylor (The Women of Brewster Place), the anthology includes such familiar names as Alice Walker, Maya Angelou, Charles Johnson, Ralph Ellison, Jamaica Kincaid and Ntozake Shange, and such relative newcomers as Edwige Danticat. In their tales, characters normally found in the wings of fiction move to center stage, and some conventional literary perspectives (as perceived by white Americans) are turned inside out. In the stories about slavery, literature challenges mythical history as a source of authority about the past. Sherley Anne Williams's "Meditation on History" is by turns ironic and heartrending in its account of a slave uprising from the points of view of the aggrieved, patronizing master and the desperate slaves. Likewise, depictions of plantation life by John Edgar Wideman, Samuel Delaney and Carolivia Herron explode the nostalgic myth of gentility and loss exemplified by Gone with the Wind. James Baldwin's "Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone," as well as coming-of-age narratives by Toni Cade Bambara and Harold Gordon, features protagonists looking back to that moment when their vague, pervasive uneasiness culminates in bitter recognition of disenfranchisement. Freed from ideological constraints, many of the writers lead their characters bravely through the shadowy realm of racial ambivalence. The collection, in fact, highlights an African American tradition that has itself come of age, one that is poised to irrevocably alter the country's literary sensibilities. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Both these collections are fabulous. Although some authors?e.g., Rita Dove, Alice Walker, Ann Petry?appear in both works, there is no repetition of material, and each title contains stories by many less-familiar authors. There are a few major differences in emphasis. Revolutionary Tales is chronological, starting in 1859, and its focus is the work of African American women. Children of the Night includes male and female authors, stressing the period 1967 to the present. The former has useful annotations at the beginning of each piece, while the latter has tried to provide a sequel to the well-received short story collection of 1969 (Best Short Stories by Black Writers), edited by Langston Hughes. In her editor's note, Naylor (Bailey's Cafe, LJ 9/1/92) makes it clear that her choices are bound together by differing treatment of the same subject and by geographic location. Both books include biographical information about their respective contributors, but Revolutionary Tales is more detailed. Readers who want a glimpse of the breadth of African American life will not be disappointed by either work. If there is room in your library budget, buy copies of both.?Susan M.

Reprint. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>"The single most important discovery for women explorers may be the freedom that lies at the very act of exploration." It is fitting that the daughter of Anne Morrow Lindbergh pens the introduction to a collection that pays tribute to women adventurers from the 18th to the 21st centuries. In her foreword, Reeve Lindbergh reveals the intrinsic yearnings that unite the early female adventurers with their contemporary counterparts: the thrill of breaking new ground and the relief inherent in escaping restrictive societal boundaries. <p> Liberated from the dusty shelves of the National Geographic Society and bound in a slim, portable volume, these 16 snapshots profile daring women from past and present, pairing them according to their wayward desires ("The Call of the Arctic," "Down River," "Where the Air Is Thin"). Helen Thayer's solo trek to the North Pole in 1988 is particularly powerful: "The feel of the wind lashing my body and face without mercy, and a savage hunger and thirst combined to make me dig into a reservoir of strength.... I dug so deep that I came up with reserves I never knew I had." </p><p> In some cases, the accounts of the early pioneers are lacking in detail and correspondingly lack the punch of their contemporary counterparts, yet some, like the piece on Louise Arner Boyd, serve to highlight the freedom so treasured by brave independent adventurers: </p><blockquote>Far north ... are lands that hold one spellbound. Gigantic imaginary gates with hinges set in the horizon seem to guard these lands. Slowly the gates swing open, and one enters another world where men are insignificant amid the awesome immensity of lonely mountains, fjords, and glaciers.</blockquote><p> The adventure connoisseur may be frustrated by the brevity of some portraits as well as the brusqueness with which both tragedy and victory are conveyed. Ultimately, however, <i>Living with Cannibals</i> succeeds in fulfilling a greater purpose--to prop open the door for further explorations into the hearts of the world's most overlooked pioneers. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Drawing on the National Geographic archives, Slung (Murder and Other Acts of Literature, 1997, etc.) deftly highlights 16 noted women adventurers who climbed mountains, met with cannibals, and lived in space. A graceful introduction by Reeve Lindbergh suggests that these women's endeavors were explorations of the limitless inner spaces of the spirit that their journeys revealed to them as much as they were explorations of unknown external terrain. Women like the photographer and Arctic explorer Yva Momatiuk (stick me on a hill in the Arctic for a week and I'll be fulfilled) or the once-ailing Isabella Bird Bishop (who in the mid-1800s began traveling the globe, venturing as far north in the Canadian wilderness as Hudson Bay, and found that knocking about, open air life, in combination with sufficient interest, is the one in which my health and spirits are best). Divided into eight sections (each sharing such common themes as flight or exploration in Africa), the profiles range in time from the 18th century to the present--a range that is a pertinent reminder that the intrepid woman of spirit and curiosity is not merely a contemporary phenomenon. Slung introduces women like Austrian Ida Pfeiffer (who survived encounters with cannibals and headhunters in Borneo and Sumatra, and explored the Brazilian rain forest), French rock climber Catherine Destivelle (who has climbed the north face of the Eiger and the challenging Nameless Tower in the Karakorams), Shannon Lucid (who spent time on the Mir space station), Louise Arner Boyd (a wealthy debutante who explored and photographically documented the Arctic in the 1920s and '30s), and Florence Baker (a Hungarian who was rescued from slavery in Turkey and discovered a source of the Nile River with her husband Sam in the 1860s). Intriguing introductions to remarkable women that whet rather than satisfy the appetite. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

The 17 selections include such milestones as Batman's first appearance in May 1939, the two-page story of his origins from November 1939, and the 1940 introduction of his young partner, Robin, an innovation that lightened the series' grim tone and set the stage for its long-running success. Other stories feature early appearances by some of Batman's most renowned arch-enemies: the Joker, Catwoman, and Two-Face. Although every story sports the contractually obligated signature of Batman creator Bob Kane, the artwork is by a variety of ghosts with wildly differing styles, which makes the collection something of a mixed bag. Most compelling are the earliest stories; crude as they are, their naive verve and raw directness remain effective. The moody, pulp-magazine-inspired style of Batman's first years soon gave way to the slicker, blander look that characterized his comics until revisionist artists and writers returned to his noir roots three decades later. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But Darwin didn&#x2019;t just stop at feeling that there was some connection between humans and dogs. A great naturalist, pioneer of the theory of evolution, and incurable dog-lover, Darwin used his much-loved dogs as evidence in his continuing argument that all animals, including human beings, descended from one common ancestor. Emma Townshend looks at Darwin&#x2019;s life through a uniquely canine perspective, from his fondly written letters home inquiring after the health of family pets to his profound scientific consideration of the ancestry of the domesticated dog. Vintage photographs of dogs, together with modern diagrams, help show the visual aspects of the evolutionary theory.</p><p>Emma Townshend has degrees in history and history of science from Cambridge, Imperial College and UCL, and her postgraduate thesis involved research about Darwin&#39;s correspondence with plant breeders and gardeners. She has taught courses on Darwin since being a postgraduate at Cambridge in 1994, most recently for the Department of Continuing Education in Oxford, and was particularly involved in Oxford&#39;s online course project ?All learn&#39;, run in cooperation with Stanford and Yale, for which she wrote a course under the aegis of Richard Dawkins.She has recently written on Darwin&#39;s connections with the Royal Botanic Garden for Kew Magazine, and will be giving special guided tours of Kew in Darwin&#39;s bicentenary year, 2009. A regular guest on radio and TV including the World Service, Radio 4 Womans&#39; Hour, A Hard Act to Follow, and BBC2 Newsnight, Emma Townshend is the Independent on Sunday&#39;s weekly garden columnist and writes regularly for the Times&#39; arts pages.All in all, Darwin&#39;s Dogs is thoroughly entertaining and informative. It is the ideal antidote to Darwin fatigue. --Nature</p><h2>THE CYCLES OF HEAVEN - Cosmic Forces and What They Are Doing to You</h2><p>Cosmic rays, sunspots, electromagnetic waves, biometereology, solar energy, climatic changes &amp; how they affect our lives. with dustjacket, clean copy</p><p></p><h2>The Wild Turkey: Biology &amp; Management</h2><p><li>A National Wild Turkey Federation and U.S. Forest Service book </li><li>Standard reference for all subspecies </li><li>Extensive, new information on all aspects of wild turkey ecology and management <p>The standard reference for all subspecies--Eastern, Gould's, Merriam's, Florida and Rio Grande--<i>The Wild Turkey</i> summarizes the new technologies and studies leading to better understanding and management.</p><p>Synthesizing the work of all current experts, <i>The Wild Turkey</i> presents extensive, new data on restoration techniques; population influences and management; physical characteristics and behavior; habitat use by season, sex, and age; historic and seasonal ranges and habitat types; and nesting ecology.</p><p>The book is designed to further the already incredible comeback of America's wild turkey.</p></li></p><p>James Dickson is a Stackpole Books author.</p><h2>Sea Rovers, Silver, and Samurai: Maritime East Asia in Global History, 1550&#x2013;1700 (Perspectives on the Global Past)</h2><p><p><i>Sea Rovers, Silver, and Samurai </i>traces the roots of modern global East Asia by focusing on the fascinating history of its seaways. The East Asian maritime realm, from the Straits of Malacca to the Sea of Japan, has been a core region of international trade for millennia, but during the long seventeenth century (1550 to 1700), the velocity and scale of commerce increased dramatically. Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese smugglers and pirates forged autonomous networks and maritime polities; they competed and cooperated with one another and with powerful political and economic units, such as the Manchu Qing, Tokugawa Japan, the Portuguese and Spanish crowns, and the Dutch East India Company.<br><br>Maritime East Asia was a contested and contradictory place, subject to multiple legal, political, and religious jurisdictions, and a dizzying diversity of cultures and ethnicities, with dozens of major languages and countless dialects. Informal networks based on kinship ties or patron-client relations coexisted uneasily with formal governmental structures and bureaucratized merchant organizations. Subsistence-based trade and plunder by destitute fishermen complemented the grand dreams of sea-lords, profit-maximizing entrepreneurs, and imperial contenders. Despite their shifting identities, East Asia&#x2019;s mariners sought to anchor their activities to stable legitimacies and diplomatic traditions found outside the system, but outsiders, even those armed with the latest military technology, could never fully impose their values or plans on these often mercurial agents.<br><br>With its multilateral perspective of a world in flux, this volume offers fresh, wide-ranging narratives of the &#x201c;rise of the West&#x201d; or &#x201c;the Great Divergence.&#x201d; European mariners, who have often been considered catalysts of globalization, were certainly not the most important actors in East and Southeast Asia. China&#x2019;s maritime traders carried more in volume and value than any other nation, and the China Seas were key to forging the connections of early globalization&#x2015;as significant as the Atlantic World and the Indian Ocean basin. Today, as a resurgent China begins to assert its status as a maritime power, it is important to understand the deep history of maritime East Asia.</p></p><p><b>Tonio Andrade (Editor) </b><br> <b>Tonio Andrade</b> is professor of history at Emory University.<br><br><b>Xing Hang (Editor) </b><br> <b>Xing Hang</b> is assistant professor of history at Brandeis University.<br><br><b>Tonio Andrade</b> is professor of history at Emory University.<br><br><b>Xing Hang</b> is assistant professor of history at Brandeis University.<br><br><b>Tonio Andrade</b> is professor of history at Emory University.<br><br><b>Xing Hang</b> is assistant professor of history at Brandeis University.</p><h2>Once Upon a Midlife: Classic Stories and Mythic Tales to Illuminate the Middle Years</h2><p>Looks at twenty tales that offer unexpected approaches to handling the problems of middle age</p><p>Allan B.

In <i>Cannabis for Chronic Pain</i>, Dr. Rav explains the potential of marijuana&#x2019;s capacity for healing anyone afflicted with chronic pain. Medical marijuana is a safe, non-addictive alternative to dangerous opiate pain pills.<br> <br>Along with sharing his own story of using medical marijuana to heal from a severe case of shingles, Dr. Rav guides you through the cannabis and holistic treatment for your specific chronic pain condition. If you are suffering from arthritis, back pain, migraines, fibromyalgia, menstrual cramps, IBS, Crohn&#x2019;s Disease, anxiety, depression, or pain from cancer or its treatment, this may be the book for you.<br> <br>Dr. Rav offers step by step instruction on the benefits and appropriate use of medical marijuana. And he dispels many of the misconceptions. Did you know that you don&#x2019;t have to smoke or eat cannabis for it to be effective? There are now patches and drops. We are entering a new age of acceptance and perhaps most importantly, as Dr. Rav highlights, it is now possible to create a distinct cannabis prescription for different types of chronic pain. Find what works for you and finally get the relief you need.<br> <br><i>Cannabis for Chronic Pain</i> is the new, definitive guide for anyone who suffers from chronic pain.</p><p>Dr. Rav Ivker is a holistic family doctor with nearly five decades of experience treating more than 70,000 patients. He&#x2019;s written seven holistic healing books, most notably <i>Sinus Survival:</i> <i>The Holistic Medical Treatment for Sinusitis, Allergies, and Colds </i>(Tarcher/Penguin). He is a board-certified holistic physician (ABIHM) and a Fellow of the American Academy of Family Physicians and runs his own holistic medical practice in Boulder, Colorado.Cannabis for Chronic Pain Introduction<p></p> Chronic Pain Is a Blessing Disguised as a Curse<p></p> <br>Joy and Woe are woven fine, a clothing for the soul Divine. &#x2019;Neath every grief and pine, runs a joy with silken twine. Human beings are made for joy and woe, and when this we rightly know, through the world we safely go.<br> <br>&#x2014;William Blake, an English poet, painter, and printmaker (1757&#x2013;1827)<br> <br>I awoke with the pain hitting me like a bolt of lightning, as if I were being electrocuted. I had never felt a pain like this.<br> <br>The diagnosis was easy. The grotesque blistering rash resembling chicken pox protruding from purplish skin along the left side of my abdomen and around my left flank to my back was unmistakable.<br> <br>During my forty-four years as a family doctor I&#x2019;d seen many patients suffering with shingles and this was a classic textbook case. The pain I experienced on that early-spring morning in March 2015, which I rated a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10, would soon progress to an 8 or 9 as my baseline pain level&#x2014;i.e., it never went below an 8. This baseline persisted for another two months.<br> <br>By the end of that first week and lasting for another four weeks, I had 10s and even 10+s (off-the-chart pain)! I referred to the latter as zingers. Fortunately when they hit me they didn&#x2019;t last long. But my memory of them will remain vivid for the rest of my life. The zingers were flashes of excruciating pain, far beyond the baseline of an 8 and greater than a 10. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine a pain worse than this. They came out of nowhere, with absolutely no warning, and literally took my breath away, and I yelled as if I&#x2019;d just been shot or stabbed in my belly. (I&#x2019;m assuming the pain was similar since I&#x2019;ve fortunately never had either experience. I&#x2019;ve since been told by a patient who&#x2019;s endured both that the pain from shingles is actually worse than a gunshot.)<br> <br>The zingers were totally incapacitating, and caused me to spontaneously curl up in a fetal position. This reflexive movement was my body&#x2019;s response&#x2014;to try and protect itself, to stop the pain, and to prevent it from recurring, all at the same time.<br> <br>In the flick of a switch that traumatized me, along with my T-10 spinal nerve, my former life disappeared. I had been transformed from a vibrantly healthy sixty-eight-year-old guy to a survivor cowering in fear of the jolts of pain. My mind&#x2019;s sole focus was riveted on relieving the agony. It was all-consuming.<br> <br>To describe this as a humbling experience would be a gross understatement. For someone who had enjoyed a high degree of control through most of my adult life and had treated more than seventy thousand patients, I was now rendered completely powerless to affect what was happening to my body.<br> <br>I found myself in a desperate situation, at the mercy of a vicious and relentless microscopic organism. I had absolutely no control of how my body reacted to the zingers. I was unable to stifle the screams and remain a silent sufferer. It felt like I was wearing an electrocuting belt strapped around my waist that was always turned on. And manning the control switch was a deranged, sadistic individual who took great pleasure in turning up the current to the max and zapping me whenever he chose.<br> <br>My initial reaction to this horrific situation was to feel anger with myself. I was highly self-critical for having allowed myself to become so stressed that my immunity broke down to a point where I contracted the virus. &#x201c;I know lots of stress management techniques. Why didn&#x2019;t I do them? And why didn&#x2019;t I get the shingles vaccine?&#x201d; Such a simple preventive measure that I had failed to do. I also felt anger with God for allowing this to happen to me. &#x201c;What did I do to deserve this?&#x201d;<br> <br>Shame was also included as part of my emotional pain; shame for being so physically weak that I had become vulnerable to the virus, when the primary focus of my personal and professional practice for the past thirty years had been optimal health&#x2014;this was a long way from that state of well-being. I grieved and cried over the loss of my physical strength and vitality and a relatively happy life. They were gone, and I had no idea if I&#x2019;d ever regain them. I had great empathy for the vast majority of my patients who were also suffering with chronic pain. But perhaps the emotion that I was least able to express was fear. I was afraid of the pain itself, and of the unknown. How long would it last? Would I be able to relieve the pain enough to work, to play with my grandkids, and to enjoy my life again?<br> <br>Enduring chronic pain is like being tortured without any letup. Chronic means that to some extent it&#x2019;s always there, like a jammed switch that won&#x2019;t turn off. (Medically, it&#x2019;s defined as pain that persists beyond three months.) And if the pain level remains at a level 5 or higher, then you&#x2019;re presented with a formidable challenge in shifting your focus to anything else for more than a few minutes. The degree of difficulty in diverting attention away from the pain increases exponentially with each higher numeric rating. For me, pain beyond a 6 made it nearly impossible to function well. Other than the zingers that occurred throughout the first month, the pain persisted at a baseline level between 8 and 9 for more than two months and was never lower than a 5 baseline for the first six months. This was the case only when not using medical marijuana.<br> <br>Never in my life had I experienced chronic pain or any pain even close to this intensity. As an athlete, I&#x2019;ve certainly had my share of physical pain from broken bones, bruises, sprains, and strains, but nothing lasting longer than two or three weeks. Whatever the injury was, I usually noticed a slight pain reduction almost daily. The shingles pain, however, was constant and the improvement measured in weeks and months. During the first nine months, it would typically take from seven to nine weeks to reduce the baseline pain level by one degree. I learned during medical school that nerves can take an exceptionally long time to heal, but now I had been given an opportunity to personally experience just how slow that process can be.<br> <br>The pharmaceutical options (primarily opioids) offered by my physician colleagues were not helpful. They were minimally effective at reducing the pain, but their side effects (drowsiness, nausea, constipation) only added to my misery and I was unable to function the way I needed to. I started to feel as if I&#x2019;d been cursed as a result of having done something really awful and been given this virus as the worst possible punishment.<br> <br>I cringe at the thought of what my life might have been like had I not decided to self-medicate with medical marijuana. Up to that point I&#x2019;d seen more than six thousand patients suffering with chronic pain who were using medical marijuana as their primary analgesic. These patients were either seeking a state license to use it for the first time or, the majority of cases, renewing their license, which in Colorado is required annually. I heard repeatedly from my patients how much more effective (with no adverse side effects) cannabis was in relieving their pain than the narcotics they&#x2019;d been prescribed. In some cases, they&#x2019;d been taking a variety of opioids for many years and had developed dependence or, even worse, an addiction.<br> <br>After first trying the conventional route during the first week, with disappointing results, I began using medical marijuana. It was miraculous! It consistently reduced the pain to tolerable levels of 3 to 4, allowing me to continue functioning at a reasonably high level. Although I always had pain, and zingers too during the first couple of months (they only occurred when I had not taken marijuana), I was successfully able to shift my focus, at least enough to have a life beyond shingles. I did not miss a day of work because of the shingles, and I was able to resume hiking.<br> <br>By the second week of my struggle with shingles I was taking at least one medical marijuana product daily, and by week seven, my usage had increased to between five and six products per day! I was amazed with both its potency as an analgesic and my ability to function (the medical marijuana products most effective for pain are somewhat lower in THC&#x2014;tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component&#x2014;and higher in CBD&#x2014;cannabidiol, the non-psychoactive analgesic and anti-inflammatory, than marijuana for recreational use). These are the two most common and most medicinal of the eighty or more cannabinoids in cannabis, and they work synergistically to relieve pain. What I personally experienced and researchers have also found is that the psychoactive effect of THC is somewhat mitigated by both CBD and severe pain&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t get too high and are able to focus on your work.<br> <br>Through a trial-and-error process and the valuable feedback I&#x2019;d received from my patients and from medical marijuana dispensary owners and employees, my cannabis medicine chest came to include a vaporizer (inhaling without smoke), tinctures (liquid extract placed under the tongue), edibles, hash oils (concentrates dispensed in a syringe and ingested), transdermal patches, topicals, and tablets. Each method of administration had its own list of benefits and minimal liabilities.<br> <br>Although marijuana was great for relieving the pain, I knew it wouldn&#x2019;t cure the problem. &#x201c;But surely I&#x2019;m not at risk for post-herpetic neuralgia,&#x201d; I thought&#x2014;i.e., shingles pain persisting beyond three months. &#x201c;That only happens to old and unhealthy people.&#x201d; Or so I thought. Wishful thinking!<br> <br>Soon after exceeding the three-month mark, I began hearing stories of people who had suffered for a year or more. One woman told me her mother had had it for more than seven years and it never resolved. She died with it in her mid-eighties. My fear increased, and the more anxious I became the more the pain increased. At this point I was also becoming somewhat depressed.<br> <br>I renewed my commitment to rid my body of this virulent virus. I tried a variety of alternative therapies recommended by several of my holistic medical colleagues, including David Perlmutter, MD, perhaps the world&#x2019;s most highly respected holistic neurologist (author of Grain Brain and his latest book, Brain Maker). Some of the recommendations I followed included: high-dose vitamin B12 injections, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) injections, high-dose IV vitamin C, acupuncture, Healing Touch, and neurofeedback, along with a host of supplements that I ingested daily, several of which were supposed to help with nerve healing. I suspect several of these treatment modalities helped in reducing baseline pain levels, but none of them made the dramatic difference I was hoping for.<br> <br>There is no question that medical marijuana (cannabis is the botanical name for the herb) has been by far the most effective therapy for quickly relieving the pain. Beside the pain relief, while its effect lasted I actually felt quite good and enjoyed a nearly normal life. Rather than being completely overwhelmed by the pain, I found it possible with cannabis to shift my focus to working, exercising, playing with my grandchildren and my wife, and maintaining my responsibilities at home. I would describe it as having a decent life while living with chronic pain.<br> <br>I had learned more than three decades earlier that through suffering with a chronic illness I was able to transform my life in ways I could never have imagined (or planned). Though in retrospect, chronic sinusitis seemed like a mild discomfort relative to the shingles, perhaps my most valuable lesson from it was that a health crisis can provide an excellent opportunity for turning lemons into lemonade. You may or may not cure the problem, but the lessons learned are vital to healing your life. I know it may seem counterintuitive, but chronic illness, dis-ease, and pain can potentially be a blessing, as long as you&#x2019;re open to that possibility.<br> <br>It took me years to first recognize this truth. After an ENT specialist delivered his dismal prognosis in 1980, telling me &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to live with it,&#x201d; I had spent nearly seven years developing a holistic medical treatment to cure chronic sinusitis. Although the dietary changes and supplements, indoor air modification, and daily nasal hygiene practices were helpful, it wasn&#x2019;t until I worked with a spiritual psychotherapist, Myron McClellan, for a full year (1986) that I was able to cure this so-called incurable condition. Chronic sinusitis is considered the world&#x2019;s most common respiratory condition, and conventional medicine has no consistently effective treatment for either curing or even significantly improving it.<br> <br>What I learned through curing sinusitis via the body-mind-spirit connection was that unconditional love is life&#x2019;s most powerful healer, and the perceived loss of love is our greatest health risk. I realized that anything is possible and that pain and dis-ease are messengers. They get our attention like nothing else can. They&#x2019;re alerting us to largely unconscious emotional and spiritual pain resulting from the loss of love from ourselves (we tend to perceive it as the loss of love from others). This in turn weakens our immune system, which then becomes a significant contributor to our physical pain and dis-ease. In short, love heals and the loss of love makes us sick and causes pain. Fortunately we currently have a multitude of studies supporting the science of connection&#x2014;the healing power of love.<br> <br>Yet in spite of the fact that I&#x2019;d been teaching these holistic healing principles to my patients and physician colleagues for the past three decades, they quickly faded from memory as soon as the shingles took over my life. My single-minded focus was to get rid of the pain.<br> <br>However, once the baseline pain level subsided to below a 5, I was ready to address the issues in the tissues. In relieving the pain and at the same time heightening my awareness, medical marijuana helped me tremendously to better understand why I had contracted this virus at this particular time, and to recognize what I needed to learn from what had initially appeared to be a horrendous catastrophe. If it is your intention to address the emotional and spiritual causes of your dis-ease while learning invaluable lessons from your pain, cannabis can be a highly effective facilitator. &#x201c;The Issues in the Tissues&#x201d; section of each of the chapters in Part II will help you begin this process, and Part III will discuss it in more depth.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s now nearly two years since I began this intensive life-changing course with shingles. I have to assume there&#x2019;s more for me to learn since I&#x2019;m still enrolled and the pain is still present, although it rarely exceeds a 2. It&#x2019;s almost always there, but rather than it being all-consuming, I frequently have to shift my attention to even notice it.<br> <br>Given this major improvement, it&#x2019;s been more challenging to stay fully engaged in the &#x201c;shingles healing program,&#x201d; even though I&#x2019;m already aware that the pain has served as a powerful catalyst for profoundly changing my life for the better. In spite of the precedent with sinusitis more than thirty years ago, it still amazes me that as I continue to heal, I&#x2019;m feeling blessed by the shingles virus and its intense physical pain. It has brought me a number of gifts, lessons I might never have received otherwise. They&#x2019;ve taken me to dimensions of mental, emotional, social, and spiritual health I&#x2019;ve never felt before.<br> <br>First and foremost I learned to surrender and accept that as hard as I might try, I am not in control of my life. This is certainly not the first time I&#x2019;ve been given this lesson, but it has su...</p><h2>Chip Kidd: Book One: Work: 1986-2006</h2><p>Described as &#34;the closest thing to a rock star&#34; in graphic design today (USA Today), Chip Kidd is universally recognized as an American master of contemporary book design. At the forefront of a revolution in publishing, Kidd&#39;s iconic covers, with their inventive marriage of type and found images, have influenced an entire generation of design practitioners in many fields.Chip Kidd: Book One collects all of his book covers and designs for the first time, as well as hundreds of developmental sketches and concepts-annotated by Kidd and by many of the best-selling authors he&#39;s worked with over the years. The result is an important contribution to the design canon today as well as a visually dazzling (and often hilarious) insider&#39;s look at the design and publishing process.The book also showcases Kidd&#39;s work with comics and graphic novels, including his collaborations with leading artists and writers in the field. Featured are projects for DC Comics, including Batman and Superman, as well as Kidd&#39;s award-winning exploration of the art of Charles M. Schulz. Chip Kidd: Book One is sure to enthrall design aficionados, book lovers, pop-culture fanatics, comics fans, and design students.</p><p>Chip Kidd is associate art director at Alfred A. Knopf. His first novel, The Cheese Monkeys, was a national bestseller and a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. He is the editor-at-large for Pantheon and the author of Peanuts: The Art of Charles M. Schulz, Batman Collected, and others. He is presently at work on a second novel, The Learners. He lives in New York City and Stonington, Connecticut.<i>Starred Review.</i> Stylishly designed and richly produced, this witty volume works both as a retrospective of Kidd's renowned book covers and as a memoir of his career in publishing. "I did not grow up yearning to become a book designer," Kidd declares in his prologue. "What I wanted to be was Chris Partridge on <i>The Partridge Family</i>." Thank heavens that plan didn't work out; ever since Sara Eisenman hired Kidd at Knopf, he's been churning out creepy, striking, sly, smart, unpredictable covers that make readers appreciate books as objects of art as well as literature. His accounts of the development of such famous covers as the clear acetate jacket for Donna Tartt's <i>The Secret History</i> and the high-gloss spot-laminate design for Haruki Murakami's <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> are fascinating. And his irresistible, tongue-in-cheek remarks keep the text from getting gushy or self-aggrandizing. Example: "One of the great advantages to designing book covers is that you don't ever have to have an idea, much less a thought, ever, in your head. That is the author's job." Publishing insiders will relish the behind-the-scenes stories. Kidd's descriptions of his design process and training make the book equally rewarding for graphic artists. This is a gorgeous gift for serious lovers of books and design. <i>(Nov. 1)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nothing could ever be the way it had been before Elena died. Nothing. And Bonnie had serious misgivings about this party Caroline was trying to set up. A vague nagging in the pit of her stomach told her that for some reason it was a very, very bad idea.</p><p>"Meredith's birthday is already over," she pointed out. "It was last Saturday."</p><p>"But she didn't have a party, not a real party like this one. We've got all night; my parents won't be back until Sunday morning. Come on, Bonnie -- just think how surprised she'll be."</p><p>Oh, she'll be surprised, all right, thought Bonnie. So surprised she just might kill me afterward. "Look, Caroline, the reason Meredith didn't have a big party is that she still doesn't feel much like celebrating. It seems -- disrespectful, somehow--"</p><p>"But that's wrong. Elena would want us to have a good time, you know she would. She loved parties. And she'd hate to see us sitting around and crying over her six months after she's gone." Caroline leaned forward, her normally feline green eyes earnest and compelling. There was no artifice in them now, none of Caroline's usual nasty manipulation. Bonnie could tell she really meant it.</p><p>"I want us to be friends again the way we used to be," Caroline said. "We always used to celebrate our birthdays together, just the four of us, remember? And remember how the guys would always try to crash our parties? I wonder if they'll try this year."</p><p>Bonnie felt control of the situation slipping away from her. This is a bad idea, this is a very bad idea, she thought. But Caroline was going on, looking dreamy and almost romantic as she talked about the good old days. Bonnie didn't have the heart to tell her that the good old days were as dead as disco.</p><p>"But there aren't even four of us anymore. Three doesn't make much of a party," she protested feebly when she could get a word in.</p><p>"I'm going to invite Sue Carson, too. Meredith gets along with her, doesn't she?"</p><p>Bonnie had to admit Meredith did; everyone got along with Sue. But even so, Caroline had to understand that things couldn't be the way they had been before. You couldn't just substitute Sue Carson for Elena and say, There, everything is fixed now.</p><p>But how do I explain that to Caroline? Bonnie thought. Suddenly she knew.</p><p>"Let's invite Vickie Bennett," she said.</p><p>Caroline stared. "Vickie Bennett? You must be joking. Invite that bizarre little drip who undressed in front of half the school? After everything that happened?"</p><p>"Because of everything that happened," said Bonnie firmly. "Look, I know she was never in our crowd. But she's not in with the fast crowd anymore; they don't want her and she's scared to death of them. She needs friends. We need people. Let's invite her."</p><p>For a moment Caroline looked helplessly frustrated. Bonnie thrust her chin out, put her hands on her hips, and waited. Finally Caroline sighed.</p><p>"All right; you win. I'll invite her. But you have to take care of getting Meredith to my house Saturday night. And Bonnie -- make sure she doesn't have any idea what's going on. I really want this to be a surprise."</p><p>"Oh, it will be," Bonnie said grimly. She was unprepared for the sudden light in Caroline's face or the impulsive warmth of Caroline's hug.</p><p>"I'm so glad you're seeing things my way," Caroline said. "And it'll be so good for us all to be together again."</p><p>She doesn't understand a thing, Bonnie realized, dazed, as Caroline walked off. What do I have to do to explain to her? Sock her?</p><p>And then: Oh, God, now I have to tell Meredith.</p><p>But by the end of the day she decided that maybe Meredith didn't need to be told. Caroline wanted Meredith surprised; well, maybe Bonnie should deliver Meredith surprised. That way at least Meredith wouldn't have to worry about it beforehand. Yes, Bonnie concluded, it was probably kindest to not tell Meredith anything.</p><p>And who knows, she wrote in her journal Friday night. Maybe I'm being too hard on Caroline. Maybe she's really sorry about all the things she did to us, like trying to humiliate Elena in front of the whole town and trying to get Stefan put away for murder. Maybe Caroline's matured since then and learned to think about somebody besides herself. Maybe we'll actually have a good time at her party .</p><p>And maybe aliens will kidnap me before tomorrow afternoon, she thought as she closed the diary. She could only hope.</p><p>The diary was an inexpensive drugstore blank book, with a pattern of tiny flowers on the cover. She'd only started keeping it since Elena had died, but she'd already become slightly addicted to it. It was the one place she could say anything she wanted without people looking shocked and saying, "Bonnie McCullough!" or "Oh, Bonnie."</p><p>She was still thinking about Elena as she turned off the light and crawled under the covers.</p><p>She was sitting on lush, manicured grass that spread as far as she could see in all directions. The sky was a flawless blue, the air was warm and scented. Birds were singing.</p><p>"I'm so glad you could come," Elena said.</p><p>"Oh -- yes," said Bonnie. "Well, naturally, so am I. Of course."

In 1844, when he was twelve, his job as a torch boy for Columbia Hook and Ladder Company Number Fourteen, an outstanding company of New York fire volunteers, had brought him face-to-face with the deadly consequences of such bitter rivalry. During a race between Number Five Engine and Fourteen Engine through Chambers Street to reach a fire first, one of Fourteen&#x2019;s runners fell, and their 4,200-pound double-deck Philadelphia-style engine passed over him, catching him in the back with the kingbolt. As the boy lay broken and dying on the pavement, he raised his head and called out, &#x201c;Go on, Fourteen!&#x201d; His last words became the rallying cry of Sawyer&#x2019;s company as they worked that night with the stroke pump. The pump with handles fixed on either end required seven men on each set of brakes, bars by which hand-pumped fire engines are operated. Exhausted by night&#x2019;s end, they did not mind. The backbreaking labor helped them forget their sorrow.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s always a crowd of boys,&#x201d; one observer said, &#x201c;victims of poverty and pinching and eager to earn some pennies, who vie with each other to run before the engines and hold aloft the torches that light the way.&#x201d; As a boy, Sawyer&#x2019;s occupations had been varied. Born in Brooklyn on January 1, 1832, he had worked in a bakery and shucked oysters in Washington Market until his fingers were bleeding. But running with the engines was his passion. At age nine he had been a signal boy for the immortal Cornelius Ruderson&#x2019;s Hudson Number One and vividly recalled their firehouse in a lane (now Barclay Street) running down to the North River. It exhilarated him to race before the heavy engine to lead the way with a lantern on a pole over his shoulder. One engine company, Number Fifteen, had two teams of runners, the Fly-By-Nights and the Old Maid&#x2019;s Boys, who could beat any other company to a fire. Sawyer&#x2019;s Number Fourteen, known as the Wide Awake, had only fourteen men, who were pampered lavishly by their sponsors with well-furnished parlors and well-appointed bunks in an engine house under the protective wing of St. Paul&#x2019;s Chapel. Being a volunteer was a badge of honor and made a man somebody. Such men who risked their lives for no pay were celebrities. Some were impersonated on stage in a series of plays.<br><br>Fourteen&#x2019;s new neighbor and greatest rival was Howard Engine Company Thirty-four, named after Harry Howard, an orphan firefighter. They had relocated their firehouse on Amos Street to Greenwich Village at the northwest corner of Hudson and Christopher streets, just southwest of Washington Square. Thirty-four&#x2019;s greatest volunteer was David Colbert Broderick, a gifted stone quarrier and man among men. He was darkly handsome, compact and muscular. His startling blue eyes were hidden under thick dark brows. The long line of a knife scar trailed along Broderick&#x2019;s cheek. The raised scar displayed itself boldly whenever he experienced strong emotion. For that reason, he had cultivated a dark reddish beard to hide the imperfection. It was a Dutch beard with the upper and lower lip clean-shaven. He had gotten the wound not in a war but during a battle with a Manhattan volunteer fire company. &#x201c;There was a natural human competition between our New York companies to turn out the quickest,&#x201d; Broderick said. Engine Company Twenty-six&#x2019;s battles with Company Two and Company One Hundred and Nineteen were already legendary. Broderick&#x2019;s chief rival in a competing unit, Protection Company Number Five, was Davey Scannell.<br><br>Because of the tremendous opportunities for political advancement afforded by being affiliated with a firehouse, the number of New York fire companies rocketed to sixty-four volunteer units with sixteen hundred blue-stockinged, exceedingly fit municipal workers constantly on call. Men fought to arm themselves with hooks and leather buckets, to callous their hands on pump and ax handles--to pump, chop, and scorch--anything to defeat a big blaze. Such huge numbers created a system so complex that a chief engineer, responsible for the care and operation of the fire engine, was appointed.<br><br>&#x201c;We had a natural inclination to be first at the scene.&#x201d; Broderick continued. &#x201c;Who wouldn&#x2019;t want to be first to extinguish the flames? First! God help us. We had to be first!&#x201d; He pounded his fist. &#x201c;But this competitive urge took a violent turn. Soon it was common for Company Number Thirty-four, my squad, the Red Rovers (named after the Cooper sea tale), to fight pitched battles (we called these &#x2018;scrimmages&#x2019;) for the honor of being first to put out a blaze while buildings burned to the ground. Guns and knives were frowned on, so we fought with the tools of our trade--hose butts, half spanners [hose couplers], blunderbusses, pipes [nozzles], wrenches, pry bars, ax handles . . . anything handy.&#x201d; A champion of weaker men, he was a first-rate bare-knuckle boxer, with the sloping shoulders of a powerful fighter toughened by a hundred street battles. &#x201c;Now my strategy back in New York was to settle the conflict as fast as I could,&#x201d; Broderick said. &#x201c;I would pick out the biggest guy the other company had to offer and take him on one to one--that&#x2019;s how I got this&#x201d;--he ran the tip of his index finger along the long, thin line trailing under his beard. &#x201c;I usually got beat by powerhouses like Mose Cutter, but I rallied my men each time.&#x201d; Broderick lost to the strongest the other companies had to offer. His enemies grew to respect him for standing up to them and never giving up.<br><br>Even to those who knew him best, Broderick remained a strange, extraordinary lone man who was rarely happy, often gloomy. Even in his youth he wore a savage scowl upon his face. Sawyer suspected the tough Irishman never smiled because he was in mourning. &#x201c;He has no family left anywhere in the wide world,&#x201d; he said. Broderick, born February 4, 1820, in Washington, D.C., was the son of an immigrant father, a gifted stonemason and ornamental worker in marble. His father had carved the huge marble columns and capitals for the east front of the Capitol Building and the Senate Chamber and finished the interior decorative work in 1834. Broderick&#x2019;s family moved to New York, where his father became superintendent of a marble yard. His father, of feeble constitution, died two years later from his extreme labors. When Broderick&#x2019;s mother passed away in 1843, he cared for his younger brother. A year later his brother died in a construction site explosion when a bombshell in Duval&#x2019;s Foundry Yard accidentally burst.<br><br>He grew up in the roughest quarter of New York City, the notorious lower Manhattan slum the Sixth Ward, which contained the Five Points District. For five years he served an apprenticeship to a stonecutter in a yard at Washington and Barron streets. He called it one of the most laborious mechanical trades pursued by man, &#x201c;an occupation that from its nature devotes its followers to thought, but debars him from conversation. I am the son of an artisan and have been a machine . . . I am not proud of this. I am sorry it is true. I would that I could have enjoyed the pleasure of life in my boyhood days, but they were denied to me, to my sorrow.&#x201d; He cut stone with a toothless, water-and-sand-driven, soft-iron gang saw in fifteen quarries on the East Side and on the East Aspetuck River. On tougher jobs, he used a saw-toothed implement with diamonds brazed into a blade that could slice through anything. With the help of well-placed charges of gunpowder, he carved huge blocks from the quarries. While serving at a minor post at the U.S. Custom House in New York City, Broderick joined Number Thirty-four on Gouverneur Street, where he worked their side-stroke, piano-style engine (so named because of the shape of its water box). This early pumper had seven-inch cylinders, a five-inch stroke, and a gooseneck--a swivel-jointed tube in the discharge pipe that let him accurately direct a jet of water. When Broderick, widely admired for his leadership, was promoted on May 13, 1844, his new helmet emblem, shaped like a detective&#x2019;s badge, was inscribed with the words &#x201c;Foreman,&#x201d; &#x201c;34,&#x201d; and &#x201c;D. C. B.&#x201d; arranged in a neat rectangle.<br><br>&#x201c;Goldilocks,&#x201d; one of the Red Rovers&#x2019; young runners, was so brightly golden haired that Broderick joked, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll never need boys with signal lights when he is forefront at the rope.&#x201d;<br><br>Under Broderick, the Red Rovers challenged Sawyer&#x2019;s Fourteen to a &#x201c;washing.&#x201d; To lose at a washing was one of the worst catastrophes that could befall a volunteer fireman. To play water on a fire, the engines had to line up from the source of water to the fire, one engine pumping water into another, and so on down the line. If, in the process of transferring the water, one engine could not handle the water pumped into it by the preceding machine, it was &#x201c;washed&#x201d; and, in the eyes of the members of other companies, disgraced. The battle between Fourteen and the Red Rovers took place at night in Mackerville, one of the roughest districts in New York City and a common battleground for the &#x201c;fightingest&#x201d; Irish. It was a place of squatters, tin can mansions, and shanties around Fourteenth Street and Avenue A and Avenue B. Sawyer&#x2019;s foreman, Venn, coaxed, cursed, and coddled his men for hours. A cry of &#x201c;She&#x2019;s up to the rabbits! She&#x2019;s over!&#x201d; came ringing through the cheers of the Red Rovers. They were victorious over Fourteen&#x2019;s machines. Fourteen was so stunned, some men cried as they lay on the ground exhausted. The &#x201c;Mackereville washing&#x201d; was one of the most exciting contests of the day.<br><br>&#x201c;Although his origin was lowly,&#x201d; it was said of Broderick, &#x201c;he felt stir within himself the forces of a strong nature. Though his associations were debased, he was not bound down by them and continued to rise year by year on the shoulders of the electors of the Ninth Ward.&#x201d; He was lifted to fame by his intense personal magnetism, marvelous knowledge of men, and absolute integrity. &#x201c;He learned how to work hard, handle men and get what he wanted. He was no orator, but a man made for action . . . a populist whose strength of character was only rivaled by its complexity.&#x201d;<br><br>In 1840, Broderick had been a ward heeler for Tammany Hall, the corrupt political machine of William Marcy Tweed. &#x201c;Boss&#x201d; Tweed yearned to be foreman of a New York volunteer fire company in the Democratic Ninth Ward that extended to the Hudson River west of Washington Square (now Greenwich Village) and housed New York&#x2019;s three most popular fire companies. Tweed joined several units before becoming foreman of Big Six, whose seal was a growling tiger painted on the body panel of their pumper. Tweed knew any political boss who affiliated himself with a district firehouse as their benefactor acquired that unit&#x2019;s prestige and great influence it wielded in their community. By allying himself, he gained not only a block of local voters but also a gang of street toughs to intimidate any opposition. The volunteers, tangible symbols of his authority, cracked heads at political rallies and got out the vote for him. When Boss Tweed became New York&#x2019;s &#x201c;King of Corruption,&#x201d; cartoonist Thomas Nast refashioned the tiger into a symbol of Tweed&#x2019;s corrupt organization: the infamous Tammany Tiger. He incited such public outrage that his scathing cartoons eventually brought Tweed down.<br><br>In 1845, the electors of the Sixth Ward in the Bowery tapped Broderick to receive the Democratic nomination for Congress. As a devout Irish Catholic, he believed he could &#x201c;make more reputation by being an honest man instead of a rascal.&#x201d; If he was elected, he could make a difference, but he lost to a Whig.<br><br>Broderick was a man of contradictions. Though he didn&#x2019;t smoke, gamble, or drink, he ran a New York tavern, the Subterranean, at the corner of King and Hudson streets, which catered to Irish laborers. Behind the bar he wore rough workingman&#x2019;s clothes, the class with which he most identified, yet read the great works of philosophy and literature, especially the poetry of Shelley. At the request of Colonel Jonathan Drake Stevenson, who was raising a company of soldiers to fight in the Mexican War, Broderick sold his saloon, poured the remaining barrels of whiskey down the gutter, and on April 17, 1849, resigned from the Red Rovers. As a parting gift, his men presented him with a heavy-duty, double-cased gold pocket watch. He set out from Manhattan for San Francisco, but hostilities had ceased by the time Stevenson&#x2019;s men reached the Pacific Coast. The tortuous trip crossing Central America damaged Broderick&#x2019;s health and he arrived in San Francisco on June 13, penniless and sick. The first day he vowed: &#x201c;I tell you, Sir, by God, that for one hour&#x2019;s seat in the Senate of the United States, I would roast before a slow fire in the Square! I&#x2019;ll go if I have to march over a thousand corpses and every corpse a friend!&#x201d;<br><br>His friend, Fred Kohler, a forty-year-old jeweler, assayer, former alderman, and volunteer assistant engineer in New York, joined him in San Francisco. Broad, clean-shaven, with muttonchops and a long straight mouth, Kohler had the stolid demeanor of a Quaker. In the summer, Stevenson pointed out to Broderick and Kohler that although gold flowed in rivers from the mines, gold coins were virtually unattainable in the Bay Area. The only coins accepted in San Francisco as legal tender were English shillings, French francs, and Mexican double reales--all of the same value. It would be almost ten years before San Francisco would have a government assay office to buy raw gold or a mint to manufacture coin more convenient than cumbersome buckskin pouches of gold dust. Kohler, who was clever with his hands, melted up the gold dust an idled Colonel Stevenson had bought west for fourteen dollars an ounce and cast it in five-, ten-, and twenty-dollar slugs. He and Broderick profited by putting four dollars&#x2019; worth of gold into a five-dollar piece and eight dollars&#x2019; worth into a ten-dollar coin. The muscular Broderick sweated before the furnace, striking coins from gold ingots, and casting and filing the slightly debased coins. As the first to coin money locally, as well as assay and stamp gold bars in their Clay Street office, they made enough by minting for Moffat and Company to retire for life. By Christmas Eve, 1849, Sawyer, who had followed Broderick to the goldfields, had been at sea for about two-thirds of his estimated five-month voyage to San Francisco. His ship, the Splendid, was battling the high waves and storms of Cape Horn. Sawyer was eager to become rich in the diggings and expected to reach the city by mid-February.</p><h2>Culture as Weapon: The Art of Influence in Everyday Life</h2><p>One of the country's leading activist curators explores how corporations and governments have used art and culture to mystify and manipulate us.<br><br>The production of culture was once the domain of artists, but beginning in the early 1900s, the emerging fields of public relations, advertising and marketing transformed the way the powerful communicate with the rest of us. A century later, the tools are more sophisticated than ever, the onslaught more relentless. <br><br>In <i>Culture as Weapon</i>, acclaimed curator and critic Nato Thompson reveals how institutions use art and culture to ensure profits and constrain dissent--and shows us that there are alternatives. An eye-opening account of the way advertising, media, and politics work today,<i> Culture as Weapon </i>offers a radically new way of looking at our world.</p><p>NATO THOMPSON is chief curator at Creative Time, one of New York's most prestigious and exciting art organizations. He is the editor of <i>The Interventionists: A Users' Manual for the Creative Disruption of Everyday Life; Experimental Geography: Radical Approaches to Landscape, Cartography, and Urbanism</i> (Melville House), and <i>Ahistoric Occasion: Artists Making History</i>. And he is the author of <i>Seeing Power</i> (Melville House).Culture as Weapon: The Art of Influence in Everyday Life <br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>As every artist knows, Plato argued that artists should be banned from society. A believer that we live in a pale shadow of a world of perfect forms, he felt that the arts were dangerous imitations, three degrees removed from the world of ideal forms. He feared that the arts could stir the passions of the populace, muddying the objective rationality required in the republic.</p><p>Plato&#x2019;s opinion certainly runs counter to the operating logic of society today. The United States is a consumer society awash in the products of culture. I consider movies, online programming, video games, advertisements, sports, retail outlets, music, art museums, and social networking all a part of the arts, as they all influence our emotions, actions, and our very understanding of ourselves as citizens. And as much as politicians would never call themselves artists, they all understand the value of showmanship and public relations when it comes to the machinations of governance. But as much as I would like to simply discard Plato&#x2019;s warning, it certainly haunted the writing of this book. For that artistic technique of stirring the passions and appealing to the intimate side in each of us has become inseparable from power.</p><p>In <i>Culture as Weapon</i>, I do not seek to uncover a cultural conspiracy that puppet masters deploy culture to brainwash us. Instead, I want to explain the ways in which those in power have to use culture to maintain and expand their influence, and the role that we all play in that process. Throughout the twentieth century and into the contemporary era, the world has witnessed the realization of age-old avant-garde demand that art become part of the everyday. Art and life have in fact merged.</p><p>At first blush, this train of thought strikes us as fairly obvious. We understand that media is a crucial part of how the world works. We understand that advertising has creeped into many facets of consumer life. And we even understand that spin has come to be a critical part of the political landscape. Ultimately, we understand that message-craft and manipulating the world to cater to how we feel has ingrained itself into every mechanism of power. So, if none of this is new, why write a book?</p><p>Simply stated, the industries dependent on shaping how we think have reached an unprecedented scale. As a global strategy deployed at every level, culture has become a profound, and ubiquitous, weapon. Communications and public-relations departments have become essential parts of every business. Global spending on advertising reached nearly $600 billion in 2015.1 One in seven people on the planet are on Facebook. By 2011, 91 percent of children ages two to seventeen played video games.2 In the United States, teenagers spend nearly nine hours a day looking at screens.3 And those are just the measurable aspects of culture&#x2019;s exponential growth. There are countless philosophical questions to be asked: How has the role of music in everyday life changed in the last one hundred years? How many scripted television shows can one watch? How many more creative ways are there to shape the city?</p><p>And yet, we remain unappreciative of just how dramatic this shift in the techniques of power has become. In particular, we continue to read the world as though it still has one foot solidly planted in the realm of reason. It is in our global DNA to identify as rational subjects. But perhaps, this Enlightenment-era thinking could use a heavy pause as we discover just how emotional, affective, we truly are.</p><p>Certainly this turn away from an Enlightment belief in our own rationality stands on the shoulders of great thinkers from Adorno to Gramsci, from cultural studies of the Birmingham school with figures such as Stuart Hall, Dick Hebidge, and Raymond Williams, to more contemporary, less structuralist, approaches by Judith Butler. But while I invoke some of these theories in the book, my main goal is to make sense of just how affective, how culturally savvy are the institutions&#x2014;Apple stores, Facebook, real-estate moguls, to name just a few&#x2014;that we confront daily.</p><p>I hope to demonstrate a broad-strokes reading of the uses of culture. We will define culture simply. And in doing so, we begin to see it everywhere, from counterinsurgency tactics in the Iraq War to the origins of IKEA to rock bands singing for aid for Africa to the design of the Mac to the war on drugs. It is a motley assemblage of seemingly disparate phenomena&#x2014;and intentionally so. For power is visible in the hands of our elected officials as often as it is hidden in a package of inanity. The many forms of power in our world have sophisticated approaches to reaching that very needy, fearful, and social creature we call ourselves.</p><p>One of my key hopes for this book is to echo something that Walter Lippmann had voiced long ago: that democracy is a fallible project rhetorically dependent on a rational subject, who, quite frankly, does not exist. In fact, the illusion of the rational subject has been extremely helpful in hiding the totality of these techniques. Understanding the power of association and the uses of emotion can explain a U.S. election better than a lens of capitalism. Just as Marxist philosophers in Britain sought to understand why the British populace turned away from Labour through the rise of Margaret Thatcher, just as Thomas Frank struggled to understand why working-class Kansas voted Republican, and just as, further back, Karl Marx asked why the French people rallied around the tyrant Louis Bonaparte in 1852, I want to make a further contribution to the cultural study of why people don&#x2019;t act rationally.</p><p>While it is certainly demonstrable that one can encourage a consumer to purchase Coca-Cola through a clever, large-scale advertising campaign, it remains unclear how the aggregate of advertising approaches collectively affect the opinions and actions of that consumer. It also remains unclear the secondary results of cultural manipulation when deployed by politicians, whether in the case of war abroad or at home. These cumulative effects of the deployment of affect has made for a very messy social terrain. It is sort of like a greenhouse effect of cultural production that changes our sense of the world around us.</p><p>Some compelling implications arise when we read power through its use of culture. For example, power has contributed to the strategies and vulnerabilities of social movements by manipulating media and public perception. Media activism and social movements that cull from the techniques of advertising to make a larger point have a long history, but it is useful to appreciate the double-edged nature of deploying culture. Simple facts&#x2014;that fear motivates faster than hope, that appeals to emotion do not rely on the truth, or that rationality need not drive enthusiasm&#x2014;make the terrain of activism that uses culture more precarious.</p><p>From an arts perspective, I would like to place what is considerated the traditional arts (theater, visual arts, dance, and film) into conversation with not only the commercial arts, but also public relations and advertising. In this way, we can position this more broad definition of art as something that has a potentiality for being both deeply coercive and absolutely powerful. After a century of cultural manipulation, it would be naive to discuss art without simultaneously discussing the manner in which art is already deployed by power daily. With real-estate developers and the tech boom both boldly embracing the power of art to change society, with the deployment of the use of the term <i>creative</i> to rebrand innovative capitalist design as an art, one has to appreciate, and perhaps second-guess, just how far art has come. By demystifying the inherent good of art, one can place art in the same conversation as other phenomena of daily life.</p><p>As much as this book is about public opinion, I know that public opinion is not everything. In fact, I would say a large part of power doesn&#x2019;t depend on public opinion. The Fortune 500 companies list Walmart at number one with its basic approach of low-cost consumer goods being its strategy. The second company is ExxonMobil, who continues to churn out oil for an energy dependent globe. For both of these companies, power resides in getting the basic goods to people while controlling that market. Yes, they advertise and to some degree shape their brand, but that isn&#x2019;t the formula for their massive sales. So while the uses of culture have grown immensely, they don&#x2019;t exist in a vacuum.</p><p>That said, how we understand the world certainly remains a key part of our collective journey. It&#x2019;s an obvious thing to say. But perhaps we have to appreciate that we, as evolutionary creatures, are ultimately fearful social beings who try our best to grapple with phenomena beyond our ken. We try to understand everything from climate change to global war to capitalism to biotechnology. But we can only process that information through the lens of our intimate selves. We interpret the world by way of our personal needs and desires, and so we are vulnerable to larger powers who know how to speak to those needs.</p></p><h2>The Myth of More: And Other Lifetraps That Sabotage the Happiness You Deserve</h2><p>Joseph Novello's new book has a simple but powerful message: People constantly chase after happiness, but in confusing happiness with pleasure, they set themselves up for continual frustration and failure. Pleasure is a short-term high that comes from without, while happiness is an abiding serenity that comes from within. Happiness lies in accepting who we are right now and what we have right now.<p>A major obstacle to happiness is one's "lifetraps", patterns of behavior that helped us cope in childhood but which now cause us to be dysfunctional as adults. What began as habits end up as core components of our personality. But even after overcoming these lifetraps, Novello discovered, people still need to go further to find happiness; they need to discover the spirituality within life and within themselves.</p></p><p>Joseph R.

The stranded airmen were rescued 11 days later (a story in itself, told here), but the planes had to be abandoned. This entertaining, large-format book, for which Hayes (No Easy Answers) interviewed participants in the search for the last squadron and veterans of the 1942 forced landing, illustrated with some 300 color photos, tells how the "lost squadron" was located by radar four decades later under 260 feet of ice. One Lightning was brought to the surface in 1992 and transported to a hangar in Middlesboro, Ky., where it is undergoing reconstruction. The effort, funded by private investors, required eight expeditions over a period of 11 years. More than a technical chronicle of a unique archeological project, Hayes's text also recounts the organizational and emotional dynamics of the venture and the tensions that occasionally erupted in physical violence.

Nowadays, except for one of the planes, they are 250 feet under the cap's surface. The exception, now being restored to flight worthiness, was excavated in 1992. The vintage plane world is all agog about this resurrection, and this documentation verily meets every demand for every detail of the expeditions that located and dug out the Lightning fighter. Pictures galore, including insouciant snapshots of their mishap taken in 1942 by the original pilots (all were safely rescued), accent the winding chronicle of discovery and recovery. It started with two Georgian aviators who in 1980 became fixated on finding the planes, infected others with their enthusiasm, and then hauled off to Greenland, ice augurs, ice-penetrating radars, and metal detectors in tow. Author Hayes does this group proud and truthful (he doesn't flinch from telling its infighting and animosities), and airplane aficionados will examine every page, studded as the pages are with hundreds of color photos. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Images of Power: Aboriginal Art of the Kimberley</h2><p>The extraordinarily creative and varied output of artists of Northwestern Australia express different ideas and use different techniques but are united in having a visual &#39;voice&#39; that reinforces the Aboriginal&#39;s rights to the land.

In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen reveals little of her creation&#39;s past or present, banishing him for quite two thirds of her book. But who is Fitzwilliam Darcy? In Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman, Pamela Aidan answers that intriguing question by taking the reader into Darcy&#39;s world, a world very different from Elizabeth Bennet&#39;s. An Assembly Such As This, the first volume in the Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy, introduces the reader to Darcy during his visit to Hertfordshire. Chronicling his supervision of his naive friend Charles Bingley and his growing fascination with Elizabeth Bennet, it culminates in the disastrous ball at Netherfield and Darcy&#39;s subsequent return to London with the express intention of forgetting Elizabeth. Set vividly against the colourful historical and political background of the time of the Regency, Pamela Aidan writes in a style comfortably at home with Jane Austen but with a wit and humour very much her own.

Like much of what Congress has done about immigration since then, it was conceived in ignorance, was falsely presented to the public, and had consequences undreamt of by its creators. That May 1882 statute, which has long been treated as a minor if somewhat disreputable incident, can now be seen as a nodal point in the history of American immigration policy. It marked the moment when the golden doorway of admission to the United States began to narrow and initiated a thirty-nine-year period of successive exclusions of certain kinds of immigrants, 1882-1921, followed by twenty-two years, 1921-43, when statutes and administrative actions set narrowing numerical limits for those immigrants who had not otherwise been excluded. During those years a federal bureaucracy was created to control immigration and immigrants, a bureaucracy whose initial raison d'etre was to keep out first Chinese and then others who were deemed to be inferior.The most comprehensive historical work on American immigration policy posits a different periodization, distinguishing between "the development of a regulatory system" in 1883-1913 and a period that went "from regulation to restriction" in 1913-29.1 This seems to me to make a false distinction: in fact each narrowing of the grounds of admission to the United States made subsequent narrowings easier. The same would be true in reverse, when restrictions were progressively relaxed from 1943 on. In the decades following World War II, even as the immigration laws and regulationswere loosened and made less discriminatory, the second generation of immigration historians tended to assume that immigration would never again be a major factor in American life. From a vantage point at the beginning of the twenty-first century, however, it now appears that the period of intense restriction, which eventually resulted in very small numbers of immigrants, was a temporary rather than a permanent alteration in a general pattern.The clearest way to demonstrate the apparent continuity of immigration patterns in modern American history is to examine the percentage of foreign-born residents in the country, whom the census began to count only in 1850 vis-�-vis the gross number of immigrants admitted. The data show that between 1860 and 1920, a period when almost every aspect of American life was transformed, the incidence of immigrants in the American population was remarkably stable: in seven successive censuses, about one American in seven was foreign-born, the actual percentages varying only between 13.2 and 14.7 percent. The total number of resident immigrants grew steadily from 1850 to 1930, but their incidence in the population began to decline in 1910 and hit a low of 4.7 percent--less than one American in twenty--in 1970. This was well after immigration had begun to grow again, but the drop in incidence continued due to the high mortality among foreign-born because so many were old and so few immigrants had arrived in the previous four decades.a Because of depression, war, and immigration policy, fewer immigrants came to the United States between 1931 and 1971--7.3 million--than had arrived in the single decade 1901-10, even though the population in 1970 was more than twice as large as that in 1910. Since 1970 the number and incidence of immigrants have risen, but that incidence is still well below traditional levels. The commonly held perception that America is receiving an unprecedented proportion of immigrants is false.What has changed, however, have been American attitudes toward immigration and immigrants. One issue that this book explores is the dualistic attitude that most Americans have developed toward immigration and immigrants, on the one hand reveling in the nation's immigrant past and on the other rejecting much of its immigrant present.That the United States, along with a number of other "settler societies," is a nation of immigrants goes almost without saying.2 Despite this, most historians do not accord either immigration or immigration policy the attention these topics deserve, and the space allocated to them in most textbooks is both cursory and spasmodic. Most still maintain the old invidious distinction between the earlier "colonists" and the later "immigrants."The founding fathers knew that continued immigration was vital to help fill their largely empty new nation. Thomas Jefferson's list of complaints against King George III in the Declaration of Independence included the charge that the king had "endeavored to prevent the population of these States ... obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners [and] refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither." Eleven years later the authors of the Constitution clearly had immigration in mind when they provided that Congress should "establish a uniform rule of naturalization" (Article I, Section 8) and made immigrants eligible for all federal offices save president and vice president. They also protected the foreign slave trade, a major source of immigration, by prohibiting interference with it for twenty years (Article 1, Section 9). When that period expired, Congress, at President Jefferson's invitation, promptly made that trade illegal, but did not interfere with either the domestic slave trade or slavery itself. The approximately 50,000 slaves smuggled into the United States after 1808 became the first illegal immigrants.President George Washington and all his successors through John Tyler took it as a given that continued immigration was vital for the health of the nation. While none made as blunt a declaration as the nineteenth-century Argentine statesman Juan Bautista Alberdi, who insisted that "to govern isto populate," their endorsements were unambiguous. Washington, addressing an association of Irish immigrants just after the battle of Yorktown, said:The bosom of America is open to receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all nations and religions, whom we shall welcome to participate in all of our rights and privileges, if by decency and propriety of conduct they appear to merit the enjoyment.3The anti-immigrant legislation of the John Adams administration in the late 1790s--the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts--was not so much an effort to restrict immigration as a desperate but vain attempt to keep Federalism in power and Jeffersonians out. Federalists generally opposed only those immigrants who they thought might vote for Jefferson. Apart from that episode, a pro-immigrant consensus long prevailed, a consensus well described in President John Tyler's 1841 message to Congress: "We hold out to the people of other countries an invitation to come and settle among us as members of our rapidly growing family."4Thus for the first sixty years, and beyond, immigration and naturalization laws were minimal. Congress quickly enacted a 1790 statute specifying that naturalization was restricted to "free white persons."5 The obvious intention was to bar the naturalization of blacks and indentured servants. (The French constitution of 1789 had similarly barred the suffrage of persons "in livery.") This naturalization act, as amended, was used later to bar the immigration of Asians, but there is no evidence that Congress had Asians in mind in 1790, and, in fact, a number of Asians were naturalized in the middle decades of the nineteenth century, at least one of them at the behest of the federal government.6 And the first statute dealing directly with free immigration was not enacted until 1819, when Congress ordered, as part of a statute dealing with import duties, that every vessel entering an American port deliver a manifest of passengers being landed to the collector of customs for that distriet.7 No other immigration statutes were enacted until after the Civil War.The political elites' positive consensus about immigration and absence of legislative regulation does not mean that immigration was universally popular. Many Americans had long held hostile feelings toward immigrants in general and certain types of immigrants in particular--a position that has come to be known as nativism. The historian John Higham, its premier explicator, has defined it as "intense opposition to an internal minority on thegrounds of its foreign (i.e., 'un-American') connections."8 I will use the word more broadly to describe persons, organizations, and movements that oppose immigration or the amount of immigration on whatever grounds, and I shall use it often in the plural.bAmerican nativisms are older than the United States. For example, early in the eighteenth century a Boston mob tried to prevent the landing of Protestant Irish and later in the century that transplanted Bostonian Benjamin Franklin published one of the first nativist tracts. His <i>Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind</i> (1751) had as its main target the burgeoning German immigration in Pennsylvania, but also demonstrated a broad, if to us curious, racism.Why should the Palatine boors be suffered to swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours? Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of us Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Customs, any more than they can acquire our Complexion.Franklin's comments are typical of American complaints against immigrants irrespective of time and place: they have bad habits ("Palatine boors"); they are clannish ("herding together"); they don't speak English ("their Language"); and they are going to take over ("Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them"). These are the arguments used against Italians, Jews, and others a hundred years ago, and may be heard today against "Mexicans, Latinos, Hispanics, etc." The targets have changed, but the complaints remain largely the same. Their gravamen is simply this: they are not like us.Franklin went on to demonstrate the degree to which notions of race are relative rather than absolute. He noted that the number of "purely white People in the World is proportionately very small," but his notion of who was white was strangely narrow. Most Europeans were not white but, according to him, "swarthy": in this category he mentioned Spaniards, Ital-ians,French, Russians, Swedes, and Germans except for the Saxons, "who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth."Finally, Franklin proposed an explicitly racist immigration policy: "Why Increase the Sons of Africa, by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red?"9 Yet, although Franklin can justly be called a founding father of American nativism, he was a father with no intellectual children. And it should be noted that this theme does not recur in Franklin's writings and that the forty-five-year-old American had not yet been abroad when he wrote these sentences. In his old age he encouraged immigration from the European continent.cNo concerted anti-immigrant movement developed in America until almost a century later. But when many thousands of desperately poor Catholic Irish immigrants began arriving at East Coast ports in the mid-1840s, many of them fleeing the consequences of the terrible potato famine that killed more than a million Irish, the pro-immigration consensus was weakened. (Many of the immigrants had been subsidized to emigrate by Irish landlords and the British government.) In reaction, Massachusetts and New York passed laws taxing and otherwise impeding immigrants. These were appealed to the Supreme Court, which struck them down in the <i>Passenger Cases</i> of 1849, ruling that: 1) although the Constitution said nothing about immigration directly, it was clearly "foreign commerce," which the Constitution explicitly reserved to Congress; and 2) Congress's jurisdiction was preemptive so that even in the absence of any federal legislation, state governments could not regulate immigration.10Immigration had been growing very quickly in the antebellum decades. In the 1830s, 600,000 came, 1.7 million arrived in the 1840s, and 2.6 million in the 1850s, which amounted to a 433 percent increase over two decades. About a third of the immigrants were Irish, almost all of them Catholic, and another third were German, a large segment of whom were Catholics. Irish immigrants went largely to the northeastern United States, many entering through Boston and New York, with a substantial minority entering via Canada. Almost all Irish settled in cities as far south as Baltimore and as far west as Cincinnati: large numbers of them moved into newurban occupations such as policemen, firemen, and horse-car drivers, as well as unskilled labor. Unlike the Irish, almost no Germans settled in New England; most entered through New York, which supplanted Philadelphia as the chief immigrant port in the 1820s. German settlement in the East was concentrated between New York and Baltimore, but a growing minority settled within the area between St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Milwaukee, which scholars have called the "German Triangle." Many Germans came seeking farms and found them, while large numbers were skilled craftsmen.The frustration of Protestant nativist groups over the increasing immigration and the growing crisis over slavery were the preconditions for the first anti-immigrant mass movement in American history. In the 1830s and 1840s violent anti-Catholic riots occurred, primarily in New England and Philadelphia: in 1834, just outside Boston, a mob burned down an Ursuline convent; and in Philadelphia during the 1840s a number of mobs attacked Catholic churches. No organization accepted responsibility, as we say today, but by the early 1850s a new political movement had been born, directed largely against immigrants.The Know-Nothings, as contemporary opponents and later historians called them, were members of a secret Protestant fraternal organization, the Order of the Star-Spangled Banner, whose members had to be native-born white Protestants who took an oath to "[resist] the insidious policy of the Church of Rome, and all other foreign influences against the institutions of our country, by placing in all offices in the gift of the people, whether by election or by appointment, none but native-born Protestant citizens." Members of the Order were instructed to reply "I know nothing" to any questions about the organization.It had a meteoric rise, growing from just forty-three members to more than a million in a little over two years. A million white males represented almost one-eighth of the nation's potential electorate (in 1852 just some 6 million men voted for president). It is therefore no surprise that anti-immigrant candidates did well in the elections of 1854 and 1855, electing eight governors, more than a hundred congressmen, the mayors of Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and thousands of other local officials. Many states enacted anti-immigrant statutes in this period. In Massachusetts, for example, naturalized citizens were denied the vote until two years after they became citizens, an act that particularly outraged Abraham Lincoln. The movement's national agenda included lengthening the period required fornaturalization from five to fourteen ...</p><h2>Points of Issue: A Compendium of Points of Issue of Books by 19th-20th Century Authors</h2><p>A point of issue occurs when a change is made in a book during its production of the first printing of the first edition without that change being noted as a changr elsewhere in the book.</p><p></p><h2>A Life in Secrets : Vera Atkins and the Lost Agents of Soe</h2><p>During World War Two the Special Operation Executive&#39;s French Section sent more than 400 agents into Occupied France - at least 100 never returned and were reported &#39;Missing Believed Dead&#39; after the war. Twelve of these were women who died in German concentration camps - some were tortured, some were shot, and some died in the gas chambers. Vera Atkins had helped prepare these women for their missions, and when the war was over she went out to Germany to find out what happened to them and the other agents lost behind enemy lines. But while the woman who carried out this extraordinary mission appeared quintessentially English, she was nothing of the sort. Vera Atkins, who never married, covered her life in mystery so that even her closest family knew almost nothing of her past. In A LIFE IN SECRETS Sarah Helm has stripped away Vera&#39;s many veils and - with unprecedented access to official and private papers, and the cooperation of Vera&#39;s relatives - vividly reconstructed an extraordinary life.</p><p>Sarah Helm was a reporter on the SUNDAY TIMES and Diplomatic Editor for the INDEPENDENT before becoming Jerusalem and then Brussels correspondent for the same paper. Now a freelance writer, Sarah was invited to undertake this project by the family of Vera Atkins.<b>1.<br><br>Nora</b><br>Vera Atkins did not, as a rule, take too much notice of the opinions of others. When it was a question of judging the character of a particular agent, especially a woman agent, she liked to make up her own mind in her own time--which was usually within a few moments of their entering the room where she first met them, at Orchard Court.<br><br>The flat in Orchard Court, just off Baker Street in London's West End, was a base used by SOE's French Section, or F Section, where headquarters staff could meet new recruits and also brief those departing on missions. Agents were never allowed into SOE's HQ in Baker Street in case they heard or saw something they did not need to know.<br><br>By the spring of 1943, when recruitment to F Section was fast picking up, a steady stream of young men and women would arrive at Orchard Court. The drill for new arrivals was by now well established. First, Park the doorman, in dark suit and tie, would lead the way (never asking names but always knowing exactly who a new arrival was) through the gilded gates of the lift and on up to the second floor. In perfect English or French, whichever they preferred, Park would then usher them into the flat and straight into a bathroom, because there was no space for a waiting room. "Back in the bathroom, please, sir [or madam]," he would say if they wandered out, and here the agents sat on the side of a deep, jet-black bath, or on the onyx bidet, surrounded by black and white tiles, while they waited to see what would happen next.<br><br>Park would then lead the agent to meet Maurice Buckmaster, the head of F Section. A tall, slender, athletic figure (he once captained Eton at soccer) with angular facial features and fair, thinning hair, Buckmaster would shake the agent's hand vigourously, then, perching momentarily on his desk, legs swinging, make a few warm welcoming remarks. To any recruit who seemed inquisitive he would say, "We don't ask questions," firmly stressing the need for secrecy at all times. He would then stride off with the recruit down the hallway and, opening another door, say, "And this is Miss Atkins."<br>Nodding towards Vera, Buckmaster would then explain, "Miss Atkins will be looking after you from now on," and as the door closed the new arrival's eyes would fall on a woman seated at a table, who produced a smile--remote but welcoming. Vera then rose, tall and trim, in twinset or tweed suit, her fair hair rolled up at the nape of her neck. This mature woman in her midthirties, most recruits assumed, must be a woman of senior rank, though exactly what rank was not at all clear as there was no uniform and she was only ever called "Madam" or "Miss Atkins."<br><br>After proffering a hand, Vera settled herself again behind a small table, showing off nicely turned ankles and smart court shoes that looked expensive but probably were not. She then slowly lit a cigarette, and her blue-grey eyes fixed upon the new recruit.<br><br>Vera appeared to know everything about the new arrival, and without referring to any piece of paper she could talk to them about their country of origin, about their family, and about their special knowledge in any field--for example, she knew if they could fire a gun, fly an aeroplane, read a map, or ski.<br><br>And Vera knew exactly where the new recruit was living, and if they needed accommodation, she would offer to arrange it. She knew of their financial circumstances as well and could offer cash advances on request up to a limited amount each month. All this was very reassuring, because until they met Miss Atkins many of these men and women had felt somewhat disoriented by the experience of "special employment," as their new work was called.<br><br>Some of the women had, just days earlier, been mopping floors at Royal Air Force (RAF) stations. Many recruits were civilians, spotted by SOE scouts, while some had just escaped across the Channel from France and had never been to England before. Few knew exactly why they had been picked out for this secret work, though it was almost certainly for little other reason than that they spoke native, or near native, French. Some were French, many had at least one French parent, and most had a cosmopolitan background.<br><br>They had been invited first for a selection interview, perhaps with a Mr. Potter, in a small, bare room numbered 055a, in the basement of the War Office. But Mr. Potter would have said little about what exactly they would be doing. Once the MI5 search into their background had safely come back indicating "no trace," they had been whisked off to sign the Official Secrets Act. But still they had no idea what it was they would be keeping secret.<br><br>Then the women went to Lilywhites to be measured for stiff new khaki serge uniforms and found themselves transformed into members of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry. The FANY, as it was known, was an organisation of ladies of a certain social standing (and in many cases with fathers or husbands in the officer corps) who volunteered for military work, driving perhaps or packing parachutes. All women agents joining SOE were obliged to join the FANY to give them "cover" while in secret training, but none yet knew anything of what that training would be.<br><br>So when the door had closed behind them and they were alone, and when Miss Atkins began to talk a little about why they had been chosen from so many others for this special work, things started to make more sense. Those recruits who had clandestine experience, such as working on resistance escape lines in France, felt that Vera had some direct knowledge of what they had been through. The less experienced felt flattered that somebody as impressive and courteous as Miss Atkins was now taking time with them. It helped, for example, to be told exactly how they should explain their new position to friends and family.<br><br>A young woman recruit named Nora Inayat Khan, seconded to SOE from the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, or WAAF, had expressed particular anxiety from the start about what to tell her mother about her new secret work. Miss Atkins suggested phrases Nora might begin to use--vague hints about going away--so that her mother, to whom she was evidently close, would get used to the ties between them loosening.<br><br>And as Vera went on to explain the setup in some detail, saying how their care and training would be arranged and how she would be following their progress day by day, the agents' confidence grew.<br><br>If before the meeting closed Miss Atkins should suggest a change in their address, their appearance, or perhaps their name, naturally they did not demur. Nora Inayat Khan took the name of Nora Baker to disguise her Indian origins. Above all else the new recruits left Vera's office with an impression that Miss Atkins was in control. Some now were even excited and eager to begin. They probably felt they had learned far more about their new work than in fact they later found they had. They had certainly learnt nothing about Miss Atkins. All they knew was that she would be looking after them from now on.<br><br>***<br><br>More than fifty years later I discovered that those young men and women interviewed at Orchard Court still knew nothing about "Miss Atkins."<br><br>"My deaa booay," said the former French agent Bob Maloubier, mimicking Vera's accent. "For me everything about her was English." "Benenden and Kensington," said another, asked to guess her background. "I knew Atkins wasn't her real name," said a third. How? "I once saw something on her file."<br><br>One former staff officer, though, had caught a unique glimpse of Vera in her very earliest days. He had met her at a bridge party at exactly the time she joined SOE. "Now let's see," said Peter Lee, reading through his diary for 1941. "When was it exactly? The tenth of March. Ha! 'Played bridge--Blitz--Boodles hit--windows out of Brooks--shaking like a jelly.' I think it was round about then. It was at Elizabeth Norman's house in Thurloe Square." Elizabeth, he explained, was the SOE secretary assigned to Room 055a, where SOE candidates were first interviewed. "The room had two tables, two chairs, and a skylight."<br><br>Peter explained that he had befriended Elizabeth because he wanted a job with SOE. "I had heard that her people were into cloak-and-dagger stuff and had the prettiest secretaries." Elizabeth often held bridge parties at her home, and on one occasion a mutual friend brought Vera along to make up a four. "None of us knew who she was. But I remember she played a very good hand at bridge, probably because she carried everything in her head."<br><br>Elizabeth Norman (now FitzGerald) recalled Vera at the bridge party as "mysterious in some way." She added: "Or rather she covered herself in mystery. And she was gracious--rather too gracious in a way that none of us really were. I think a friend of mine had met her on an ARP [Air Raid Precautions] patrol and just brought her along when we were short of a fourth person. She seemed to have come from nowhere. You see, she was so much older than us other girls. She had no context at all that I discovered. And we didn't ask--one didn't then. We had a sort of code, you know."<br><br>Elizabeth herself had started as a "snagger," a filing clerk, in MI5, which was the Eton or Roedean of Whitehall. She then moved to SOE and recalled that F Section was considered "not quite top notch," "a mixed bunch, mostly City," whereas the Balkan Section had the really "smart," wealthy types, brought in from Hambros or Courtaulds.<br><br>One of Elizabeth's jobs was to tick off recruits as they arrived for interview in 055a--"they were all told it was life and death, but it didn't seem to bother them." Often she was called over to Orchard Court to help out, usually by chatting to agents and drinking cocoa with them to set them at ease before their departure.

So, enter their lives and prepare to welcome the realm of possibility open to us all. Love, joy, and these stories will linger.</p><p>David Levithan is a children&#x2019;s book editor in New York City. He lives in Hoboken, NJ.Grade 9 Up&#x2013;Most readers will find someone they can relate to in this enchanting collection of linked poems that delve deep and go far beyond the original stereotypes. Twenty teenagers&#x2013;sensitive outsiders, cruel popular girls, body-obsessed jocks, gay teens in the throes of first love&#x2013;take turns pouring their hearts onto the pages, detailing their loneliness, heartaches, hopes, and joys. All attend the same high school, and as the book progresses their stories slowly weave together to form a larger view of the school community. In the first selection, for instance, Daniel talks about his relationship with Jed; Jed's view of their romance closes the book. Though friendships and romantic relationships grow and change, character is much more the focus here than plot. Each chapter contains four points of view, and it will take patient readers to determine who's who and exactly how they are linked. Effort is rewarded, however, in selections such as "The Patron Saint of Stoners," in which a girl seeks out a drug dealer for reasons few will guess. Another standout is "Experimentation," in which a boy writes about his sexual experiences with astonishing insight and tenderness. Thoughtful teens will find much to appreciate here.<i>&#x2013;Miranda Doyle, San Francisco Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

BOMC.</p><p>As greater numbers of naysayers look forward to the collapse of civilization, perhaps it's best to see what happened last time. It turns out the Dark Ages weren't so bad--in fact, after reading through <i>The Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages</i>, you might find yourself pining for the good old days before the Renaissance. Historian Norman F. Cantor has assembled a crack team of experts to unleash their copious knowledge on our modern world; better still, Viking Press has enlisted excellent designers to present the information efficiently and even beautifully. You'll find yourself irresistibly drawn from one entry to the next (there are over 600, so leave time for browsing) as the story of the Council of Nicaea leads on to explorations of medieval Christianity and much more. Twenty longer essays on general topics provide the foundation for the rest of the <i>Encyclopedia</i> and make great reading on their own, but the meat of the book is in the details. Lavishly illustrated in both color and black-and-white, including artworks, maps, and timetables, this reference work looks as good on the shelf as it does on the coffee table. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><h2>The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth</h2><p>Union cavalryman Boston Corbett became a national celebrity after killing John Wilkes Booth, but as details of his odd personality became known, he also became the object of derision. Over time, he was largely forgotten to history, a minor character in the final act of Booth&#x2019;s tumultuous life. And yet Corbett led a fascinating life of his own, a tragic saga that weaved through the monumental events of nineteenth-century America.<br>&nbsp;<br>Corbett was an English immigrant and devout Christian who long struggled not only with poverty but also with mental illness, which was likely caused by the mercury he used in his job as a silk hat finisher. He was one of the first volunteers to join the US Army at the outbreak of the Civil War, a path that would in time land him in the notorious Andersonville prison camp. Eventually released, he ended up in the squadron that cornered Lincoln&#x2019;s assassin in a Virginia barn. After the war, he headed west as a homesteader to the plains of Kansas, where his shaky mental health led to his undoing.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Madman and the Assassin </i>is the first full-length biography of Boston Corbett, a man thrust into the spotlight during a national news event and into an unwelcome transformation from anonymity to fame, and back to obscurity.</p><p><b>Scott Martelle</b>, an editorial writer for the Los Angeles Times, is the author of&nbsp;four previous books:<ul><li><i>The Admiral and the Ambassador: One Man's Obsessive Search for the Body of John Paul Jones </i>(Chicago Review Press, 2014)</li><li><i>Detroit: A Biography </i>(Chicago Review Press, 2012)</li><li><i>The Fear Within: Spies, Commies, and American Democracy on Trial </i>(Rutgers University Press, 2011)</li><li><i>Blood Passion: The Ludlow Massacre and Class War in the American West </i>(Rutgers University Press, 2007)</li></ul>A native of Maine, Martelle grew up in Western New York and now lives in Irvine, California.New York Post "Must read books," March 29, 2015After receiving a portion of the reward money for bringing Booth to justice, Boston Corbett disappeared from public view and died under mysterious circumstances.

Boston Corbett faced at least as much hostility as appreciation. Some believed the Union soldier was not a hero but part of a conspiracy to cover up Booth's rumored escape. Others with Confederate sympathies saw Booth as a martyr, and Corbett as the ultimate deceiver.

As the author explains in the book's final pages, it wasn't Corbett's uniqueness but his ordinariness, the fact that he was a "run-of-the-mill American--albeit a strange one--who did his job as a hatter, and then a soldier, and in the process inextricably linked himself with an unforgettable event in American history."</p><h2>Ice Story: Shackleton&#39;s Lost Expedition</h2><p>This dramatic, suspenseful narrative reads like an adventure story-but it is true. In 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton and a twenty-seven-man crew set off on an expedition to reach and cross Antarctica. Just a month and a half into the voyage, their ship, the Endurance, was caught fast in heavy pack ice. The men had no radio contact, and no one knew where they were or even that they were in trouble. None of them should have survived the ordeal that followed-unstable ice floes, treacherous waters, freezing temperatures, and starvation. Only the extraordinary leadership, courage, and strength of Shackleton brought the whole team safely through. Elizabeth Cody Kimmel&#39;s clear, compelling text is illustrated with photographs, taken and carefully preserved by the ship&#39;s photographer, that record the stark condition and the day-to-day activities of the men. Hand-drawn maps that show the extraordinary route of the Endurance and her crew. Bibliography, index.</p><p>Elizabeth Cody Kimmel lives in Cold Spring, New York, with her husband and young daughter.Grade 4-8-Having been beaten in his quest to be the first man to stand on the South Pole, Sir Ernest Shackleton set off in 1914 to cross the continent of Antarctica. He ultimately failed, but the saga of his attempt, in which his ship was frozen in ice and sunk, and yet no human lives were lost, makes a thrilling and terrifying tale. Utilizing Shackleton's memoirs and original expedition photographs, Kimmel re-creates events in exciting detail. She puts the story in historical perspective by comparing the exploration of Antarctica to the exploration of space, which plays a part in making this an accessible but not oversimplified account. After presenting a brief background about Antarctic explorers and introducing several of the primary members of the crew, the author then describes how the 28 men survived months of frostbite, penguin stew, and boredom, while hoping for rescue. Shackleton is depicted as a brave and responsible leader whose first concern was always the welfare of his men, yet who still had his own weaknesses. There has been a surge of information about this expedition lately, and this is a worthy addition to the group. Readers will cheer the endurance and ultimate survival of these adventurers while learning about history.<br><i>Andrew Medlar, Chicago Public Library, IL</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>House On The Strand</h2><p><p>In this haunting tale, Daphne du Maurier takes a fresh approach to time travel. A secret experimental concoction, once imbibed, allows you to return to the fourteenth century. There is only one catch: if you happen to touch anyone while traveling in the past you will be thrust instantaneously to the present.</p><p>Magnus Lane, a University of London chemical researcher, asks his friend Richard Young and Young's family to stay at Kilmarth, an ancient house set in the wilds near the Cornish coast. Here, Richard drinks a potion created by Magnus and finds himself at the same spot where he was moments earlier&#x2014;though it is now the fourteenth century. The effects of the drink wear off after several hours, but it is wildly addictive, and Richard cannot resist traveling back and forth in time. Gradually growing more involved in the lives of the early Cornish manor lords and their ladies, he finds the presence of his wife and stepsons a hindrance to his new-found experience. Richard eventually finds emotional refuge with a beautiful woman of the past trapped in a loveless marriage, but when he attempts to intervene on her behalf the results are brutally terrifying for the present.</p><p>Echoing the great fantastic stories of H. P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe, The House on the Strand is a masterful yarn of history, romance, horror, and suspense that will grip the reader until the last surprising twist.</p></p><p>In addition to The Scapegoat and The House on the Strand, Dame Daphne du Maurier (1907-1989) wrote more than twenty-five acclaimed novels, short stories, and plays, including Rebecca, Jamaica Inn, Frenchman&#39;s Creek, and &#34;The Birds.&#34;Michael Maloney's tense reading, punctuated by musical interludes, at first gives this production the feel of a soap opera. But his intensity energizes this bleak, chilly novel of a man unhappy in his own life and obsessed with the past, which he can visit, or view, through an experimental time-travel drug. In a novel filled with unsympathetic characters, Maloney makes protagonist Dick seem more sympathetic than he would otherwise be. He indicates various characters skillfully through small shifts of voice; his American accent for Dick's wife is flawless. No one could make this novel fun; Maloney makes it involving.

In&nbsp;<i>Black Bodies and Quantum Cats</i>, science writer Jennifer Ouellette traces key developments in the field, setting descriptions of the fundamentals of physics in their historical context as well as against a broad cultural backdrop. Newton&#x2019;s laws are illustrated via the film&nbsp;<i>Addams Family Values</i>, while&nbsp;<i>Back to the Future</i>&nbsp;demonstrates the finer points of special relativity. Poe&#x2019;s "The Purloined Letter" serves to illuminate the mysterious nature of neutrinos, and Jeanette Winterson&#x2019;s novel&nbsp;<i>Gut Symmetries</i>&nbsp;provides an elegant metaphorical framework for string theory.&nbsp;An enchanting and edifying read, <i>Black Bodies and Quantum Cats</i> shows that physics is not an arcane field of study but a profoundly human endeavor&#x2014;and a fundamental part of our everyday world.</p><p><b>Jennifer Ouellette</b>&nbsp;is the author of three previous books, <i>Black Bodies and Quantum Cats, Physics of the Buffyverse,</i> and <i>The Calculus Diaries</i>.

She lives in Los Angeles, California.Jennifer Ouellette must have been the kid who had a zillion questions ("Mommy, how can birds sit on power lines without getting fried?") and was never satisfied with the answers ("Are you sure they have wooden feet?"). She grew up to write "This Month in Physics History" for the American Physical Society's APS News, where she is an associate editor, and from that monthly column evolved Black Bodies and Quantum Cats: Tales From the Annals of Physics (Penguin; paperback, $15), which bursts with answers for curious adults.<p>She begins by trying to banish the intimidation about her subject that seeps into the adult psyche: "Physics is a far cry from being a cold, hard discipline devoid of emotional content. Its history is replete not just with technological marvels and revolutionary ideas, but also with colorful personalities and human drama." Employing contemporary cultural icons like the movie "Addams Family Values" and The Da Vinci Code, she explains the principles behind acceleration and ancient geometrical anomalies.</p><p>While her dedication to accessibility is admirable, her use of contemporary science fiction as a talisman for readers doesn't pay off for those who've already forgotten "X-Files" agent Fox Mulder. But Ouellette shines when she pulls analogies from real life to explain, for example, why blackouts are more likely since the deregulation of the power industry. </p><p>In prose that is engaging and economical, she transports us to 1947, when the physicists who guaranteed the Allies' victory in World War II got a police escort through New York. She delves into the forces behind roller coasters, canned whipped cream and Velcro, and she closes with a reminder that there "are as many open questions and elusive mysteries as there are hard established facts." </p><p> (Washington Post staff writer)</p><p>Physics for Armchair Scientists <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Emphasizing the distinctive roles women have played as producers and consumers of camp, Pamela Robertson links her subject to feminist discussions of gender parody, performance, and spectatorship. Her book offers a heady tour of social and cultural criticism at its most interesting, and American culture at its most flamboyant.<br>Robertson grounds her theoretical discussion of female performance and spectatorship in detailed studies of figures such as Mae West, Joan Crawford, and Madonna. She locates these figures in turn within a tradition of feminist camp&#x2014;a female form of aestheticism related to masquerade and rooted in burlesque, parallel to but different from gay male camp. Through analyses of films from <i>Gold Diggers of 1933</i> to <i>Johnny Guitar</i>, as well as video and television, Robertson shows how the gold digger is to feminist camp what the dandy is to gay male camp&#x2014;its original personification and defining voice. Set against a backdrop of social history, her analysis demonstrates that feminist camp flourishes during periods of antifeminist backlash in America, and that it reflects a working-class sensibility particularly attuned to changing attitudes toward women&#x2019;s work and sexuality. <br>Appealing to a wide range of scholars spanning the fields of film and mass culture, feminism, gay/lesbian/queer studies, and cultural studies, <i>Guilty Pleasures</i> will also attract an audience of general readers interested in camp and popular culture.<p></p><p></p></p><p>&#34;This is the most extensive--and the most subtle and complex--examination of the feminist &#39;angle&#39; on camp I have seen.&#34;--Alexander Doty, author of &#34;Making Things Perfectly Queer &#34;and coeditor of &#34;Out in Culture&#34;<p>Pamela Robertson Wojcik is Associate Professor in the Department of Film, Television, and Theater and Director of the Gender Studies Program at the University of Notre Dame.

In this book, star financial journalist Duff McDonald shows just how, in becoming an indispensable part of decision making at the highest levels, McKinsey has done nothing less than set the course of American capitalism. <br> <br>But he also answers the question that&#x2019;s on the mind of anyone who has ever heard the word McKinsey: Are they worth it? After all, just as McKinsey can be shown to have helped invent most of the tools of modern management, the company was also involved with a number of striking failures. Its consultants were on the scene when General Motors drove itself into the ground, and they were Kmart&#x2019;s advisers when the retailer tumbled into disarray. They played a critical role in building the bomb known as Enron.<br> <br>McDonald is one of the few journalists to have not only parsed the record but also penetrated the culture of McKinsey itself&#x2014;a corporate mandarin elite whose methods have been compared (by oth�ers and by themselves) to those of the Jesuits or the U.S. Marines.

The experience left him unimpressed, and he has looked down on it since. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s substitute management,&#x201d; he told me when I was deep into writing his biography. &#x201c;A Good Housekeeping seal of approval. It&#x2019;s political, so if you make a decision, you can say, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s not my fault, it&#x2019;s their fault.&#x2019;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think consultants can become a disease for corporations.&#x201d; Dimon, who went on to become the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase and was hailed as an Olympian financier for steering the bank above Wall Street&#x2019;s 2008 humbling&#x2014;only to be somewhat humbled himself four years later when its own trading caused more than $5 billion in losses&#x2014;made one exception to his consultant rule. Most consulting engagements weren&#x2019;t worth the price paid, he said, but McKinsey&#x2014;well, it was the real thing.<br> <br>Four years later, the Republican candidate for president, once a consultant himself, was asked how he would reduce the size of government. &#x201c;So I would have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least some structure that McKinsey would guide me to put in place,&#x201d; Mitt Romney told the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. When his audience seemed surprised, he added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not kidding. I probably would bring in McKinsey.&#x201d;<br> <br>After almost a century in business, McKinsey can lay claim to the following incomplete list of accomplishments: Once before, well before Romney was running for the presidency, it remapped the power structure within the White House; it guided postwar Europe through a massive corporate reorganization; it helped invent the bar code; it revolutionized business schools; it even created the idea of budgeting as a management tool.<br> <br>Above all, McKinsey consultants have helped companies and governments create and maintain many of the corporate behaviors that have shaped the world in which we live. And in becoming an indispensable part of decision making at the highest levels, they have not only emerged as one of the great business success stories of our time but also helped invent what we think of as American capitalism and spread it to every corner of the world. The abstract, white-collar nature of modern business&#x2014;the fact that the greatest value in our economy is now created by people sitting in air-conditioned skyscrapers and corporate parks who manipulate information&#x2014;is a reality that McKinsey was instrumental in establishing, championing, and profiting from. The best evidence for McKinsey&#x2019;s expertise is the firm itself. It has followed its own advice into an enviable position of power and prestige.<br> <br>At the same time, however, the company can also be saddled with a list of striking failures, missteps that would have doomed lesser firms. McKinsey consultants were on the scene when General Motors drove itself into the ground. They were Kmart&#x2019;s advisers when the retailer tumbled into disarray. They pushed Swissair in a direction that led to its collapse. They played a critical role in building the bomb known as Enron and collected massive fees right up until the moment of its spectacular explosion. And these are just the clients unlucky enough to have had their woes splashed across headlines. Many more have paid handsomely for guidance that shortchanged shareholders, led to unnecessary layoffs, and even prompted bankruptcies. And yet the consultants are rarely blamed for their bad advice&#x2014;at least not publicly so.<br> <br>Remarkably, that pervasive influence has come even though McKinsey contains more contradictions than the Bible. The firm is well known, but there is almost nothing known about it. Precious few McKinsey employees have ever become acclaimed in the outside world. The employees are trusted and distrusted&#x2014;and loved and despised&#x2014;in equal measure. They are a collection of huge egos that are yet content to stay behind the scenes. They are confident but also paranoid. And they are helpful yet manipulative with their clientele&#x2014;and even their own people.<br> <br>What do they actually do? They are managerial experts, cost cutters, scapegoats, and catalysts for corporate change. They are the businessman&#x2019;s businessmen. They are the corporate Mandarin elite, a private corps, far from prying eyes, doing behind-the-scenes work for the most powerful people in the world. How do they do it? Well, their methods have been compared (by others and by themselves) to the Jesuits, the U.S. Marines, and the Catholic Church. They feel so strongly about themselves that they have insisted on a proper noun where one need not exist. To an outsider, they are a consulting firm. To themselves, simply, The Firm.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>But the McKinsey story is even more than all of that. It&#x2019;s also about the rise and reach of American business in the twentieth century&#x2014;and its remarkable adaptability to changing times. American capitalism may be under stress now, but modern American management technique&#x2014;which McKinsey has played a part in both creating and disseminating&#x2014;has distinguished itself as much by its innovative ability as by its sheer might. Today McKinsey is a global success story. But first it was a distinctly American one.<br> <br>One of the secrets of McKinsey is its very similarity to America&#x2014;it has a solid foundation with an adaptive overlay, all topped off with a bit of old-fashioned luck. Make no mistake: McKinsey is not an enduring institution by accident. It has been built with much purpose. Still, could it be an accident of history, founded in the right place at the right time? Yes, but only in the same way that Google, LEGO, and Toyota are accidents. Other companies stumble into extinction.<br> <br>McKinsey started in typically American fashion: with self-invention. Although it was technically founded in 1926 by a University of Chicago accounting professor named James O. McKinsey, the mythical leader of the firm is a successor, Marvin Bower, a man whose abiding goal was to invent a new profession committed to preparing clients for the challenges and uncertainties of the onrushing future. Plenty of other firms had the same idea at the same time, some even earlier, but none could match Bower&#x2019;s discipline and focus. He distinguished McKinsey not just for what it did but for how it went about it, starting with the physical appearance of its employees and moving right on through hiring, training, and the culling of their ranks through a merciless system known as &#x201c;up-or-out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Consultants of one kind or another have existed for centuries. Han Fei Tzu, founder of the so-called legalist school of ancient Chinese philosophy and adviser to the emperor, has been called the first consultant.1 But McKinsey can nevertheless claim a remarkable number of firsts: It was the first consulting firm to realistically apply scientific approaches to management, solving business problems with a method of hypothesis, data, and proof. It was the first to gamble on youth over experience, and the first to take on the challenge of becoming truly global.<br> <br>McKinsey was a major player in the efficiency boom of the 1920s, the postwar gigantism of the 1940s, the rationalization of government and rise of marketing in the 1950s, the age of corporate influence in the 1960s, the restructuring of America and rise of strategy in the 1970s, the massive growth in information technology in the 1980s, the globalization of the 1990s, and the boom-bust-and-cleanup of the 2000s and beyond. So pervasive is the firm&#x2019;s influence today that it is hard to imagine the place of business in the world without McKinsey.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>So what is the net effect of McKinsey consultants in the world? What has been gained and lost as this relatively small group of like-minded people has consolidated power and spread the gospel of American capitalism? It&#x2019;s best to take that question from a few different perspectives.<br> <br>McKinsey&#x2019;s clients, specifically those in the executive suite and the boardroom, have gotten an extremely intelligent if high-priced sounding board, a beacon in the night of managerial uncertainty. McKinsey offers a kind of industrial espionage couched in the language of &#x201c;best practices.&#x201d; Want to know what the competition is up to? Hire McKinsey. After all, it&#x2019;s working with everyone else as well. The flip side of that argument is that your competitors find out about you too. But most clients have found the tradeoff rewarding.<br> <br>When IBM wanted to expand into Europe in the 1950s, whom did it call for some hand-holding? McKinsey. So too did scores of other companies, from Heinz to Hoover. And then when Europe started recovering its own confidence? Why, McKinsey was there to tell the likes of Volkswagen and Dunlop Rubber that they could surely bounce back from near devastation with the consultants&#x2019; help. With McKinsey&#x2019;s army of hardworking and youthful overachievers&#x2014;what one reporter called &#x201c;a SWAT team of business philosopher-kings&#x201d;2&#x2014;clients have surely gotten more effort per dollar spent than you might find anywhere else in the corporate milieu.<br> <br>They have a remarkable ability to be in the right place at the right time&#x2014;so many times, in fact, that you have to wonder whether they really can see the future. But the truth is subtler than that. They have created one of the most flexible business models in the history of Western capitalism: They sell what their clients are buying, and where the clients are buying it.<br> <br>So powerful is the McKinsey name that merely hiring the firm can bring the desired effect&#x2014;as in 2009, when publishing giant Cond� Nast brought in McKinsey to demonstrate its seriousness about reducing expenses by 30 percent. The rank and file got the message. The act of hiring McKinsey can be as symbolic as it is practical.<br> <br>Of course, criticisms of McKinsey&#x2019;s contributions to client welfare are not hard to find. For one, once McKinsey is inside a client, its consultants are adept at artfully creating a feedback loop through their work that purports to ease executive anxiety but actually creates more of it, offering and then obscuring what one author has referred to as &#x201c;an illusion of a sure path to the future.&#x201d;3 Executives can get so accustomed to McKinsey&#x2019;s presence that they can&#x2019;t function without it, leading to situations like the one at AT&amp;T in the early 1990s, when the company paid the firm $96 million over five years for ongoing work.<br> <br>In situations like this, there is a potential anticlient bias to the consultants&#x2019; business, where the long-term result is dependence on, not independence from, the consultants. In other words, once they get the wedge end of a relationship into a company in the form of one engagement, they usually manage to hammer in the rest&#x2014;becoming the so-called Men Who Came to Dinner. (To wit: They never leave.) McKinsey isn&#x2019;t actually embarrassed by this notion&#x2014;the firm calls it the &#x201c;transformational relationship,&#x201d; arguing that true change comes only from long-term relationships. But over the years, many McKinsey clients have paid for exorbitant, lengthy engagements with little to show for it.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>What the McKinsey consultant himself has gained is a far simpler question to answer. He has gained money, power, and prestige, as well as the pretense of an intellectually minded pursuit within the corporate sphere. He is not a banker, accountant, or lawyer. He is a thinker. He has had the chance to whisper into the ears of power, to exercise influence while being insulated from responsibility. McKinsey was Enron CEO Jeff Skilling&#x2019;s most favored outside adviser during the Houston natural gas company&#x2019;s rise and fall. Skilling went to jail for his transgressions; McKinsey emerged from the scandal largely unscathed.<br> <br>Perhaps best of all, a job at McKinsey is a ticket to almost anywhere in the world. The firm is the best finishing school in business, a launching pad, and a matchless r�sum� line. A job at McKinsey, regardless of duration, can serve as an enviable listening post for plum corporate roles, particularly at McKinsey&#x2019;s own clients. The firm has an astonishingly successful network of alumni, occupying corner offices and boardrooms all over the world. Lou Gerstner, the man famous for turning IBM around, worked at McKinsey before decamping for one of his clients, American Express. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman spent a decade at McKinsey before jumping ship to his client, Merrill Lynch. It literally happens about once a week.<br> <br>Of course, not everyone goes on to a distinguished career. Enron&#x2019;s Skilling came from McKinsey. Two figures convicted in the greatest insider-trading scandal in history&#x2014;the 2009&#x2013;12 investigation of convicted hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam&#x2014;are ex&#x2013;McKinsey: former director Anil Kumar as well as former managing director Rajat Gupta.<br> <br>You rarely see an old McKinsey consultant&#x2014;like its symbiotic other, the Harvard Business School, the institution favors youth over experience. McKinsey is like Harvard in other ways. To the Harvard grad, there is Harvard and there is nowhere else. Likewise McKinsey. Indeed, McKinsey alumni almost all wear their sense of specialness for the rest of their lives. This is why the Rajaratnam scandal has shaken the firm to its roots. Even though Anil Kumar sold client secrets and Rajat Gupta trashed the firm&#x2019;s long-cherished value system in a public and mortifying way, neither event really affected the firm&#x2019;s business. The damage to its self-image has been much more severe.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Finally, what of society? There is little doubt that McKinsey has made the corporate world more efficient, more rational, more objective, and more fact based. But to what extent have its contributions gone beyond the bottom line?<br> <br>McKinsey would have the world believe that its consultants are missionaries of the best in business thinking; that by pushing companies fearlessly into the future they are not just boosting profits but aiding the cause of human progress itself. There is more than some merit to this point of view. And if the smartest, most successful companies in the world continue to hire them, that in and of itself is evidence of the value they create.<br> <br>But as with many of the world&#x2019;s big firms, it is also hard to overlook the mounting number of instances in which McKinsey advisers have behaved no better than mercenaries, collecting huge fees for work of dubious worth. At their most craven, they can be recruited to provide a high-gloss imprimatur of objectivity that is in reality mere cover for executives. They are, without question, the go-to consultants for managers seeking justification for savage cost cutting as well as a convenient scapegoat on whom to blame it. While this is surely impossible to measure, there is a distinct possibility that McKinsey may be the single greatest legitimizer of mass layoffs than anyone, anywhere, at any time in modern history.<br> <br>In a sense, McKinsey is the Goldman Sachs of the consulting world. Both occupy the top rung of their respective professions, but both have come to symbolize something else as well&#x2014;a nagging question of whether all the brainpower and energy devoted to them have truly been worth the opportunity cost. Is this really where America&#x2019;s best and brightest can make their most meaningful contributions? McKinsey itself has answered that question in part by shifting its sights to a more global clientele, as the U.S. economy faces its starkest challenges in more than fifty years.

Holder of a bachelor's degree in English from the State University of New York, he worked as a folksinger and journalist before publishing his first story in <i>Analog </i>in 1973. He now lives with his wife Jeanne Robinson (co-author of the Hugo- and Nebula-winning Stardance trilogy) on an island outside Vancouver, B.C., where they raise and exhibit hopes. <br><br>Eleven of his 31 books are set in Callahan's Place, a fabulous tavern founded by a time traveler, where puns flow as freely as beer, and smell far worse. The most recent is<i> Callahan's Con</i> [Tor July 2003]. He has contributed a regular editorial column, "Future Tense," to Canada's national newspaper,<i> The Globe &amp; Mail</i>, since 1995. In 2000, he released<i> </i>Belaboring the Obvious<i>, </i>a CD of original music with the legendary Amos Garrett ("Midnight at the Oasis") on lead guitar, and in 2001 he was a celebrity judge at the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam. <br><br>This smoothly written, well-paced romp from Canadian author Robinson (Telempath) takes places in 2023 at Dreamworld, a Disneyland-style park, whose themes draw from SF, fantasy and 1960s popular culture. Twelve-year-old Mike tries to hide himself in Dreamworld, but runs into the "Mother Elf," a midget named Annie. Comparing notes, they begin to suspect that Dreamworld is being infiltrated, but by whom? They first suspect "aliens," then agents of Alonzo Haines, proprietor of Dreamworld's spatterpunk rival, Thrillworld. Then they discover that Haines's formidable enforcer, Randall Conway, is after the aliens and after them as well. Mike and Annie ally themselves with the mystery folk, particularly an ingenious little gentleman named Hormat with an arsenal of high-tech dirty tricks, simply in order to stay alive long enough to find out where Hormat is literally coming from. In due course, after Conway gets what he deserves, all secrets are revealed, with Hormat's being so unoriginal as to be almost anticlimactic. Besides piling on the warm fuzzies, Robinson pays blatant homage to Robert A. Heinlein, retelling the classic youth-and-mentor tale of that author's juveniles and referring extensively to his work in the Dreamworld themes. The conclusion hints at a sequel in which Mike and Annie will infiltrate Thrillworld. Fans of lightweight SF should be pleased. (Aug. 27)Hugo, Nebula and John W.

Her compassionate book will give you the understanding you need to give strength to women who are trying to break free.</p><p>Knowing what to do or how to help a victim of domestic violence can be baffling. Natural urges, such as badmouthing the abuser or pressuring the victim to leave the abuser, can often backfire. Victims may pull away and alienate themselves from those who are trying to help. Author Susan Brewster was stalked and battered by an ex-boyfriend. As a result she studied to become a psychotherapist and has dedicated more than a decade of her life to counseling battered women and their families. Based on her experiences, she teaches readers how to recognize abuse, become effective advocates, and take on the difficult role of being anchors rather than rescuers.The estimation that "four million women a year" are battered by their partners makes this unique guide regrettably necessary. Social worker Brewster, who has survived a batterer, aims to help those who would like to be "an anchor" to a battered woman. In contrast to a rescuer or a distancer, the anchor is a "healthy" supporter who believes the woman, takes her abuse seriously, remains neutral, respects and honors her decisions and feelings, and does not give advice. Writing in a clear, conversational style, Brewster aims to help the "anchor" with this daunting task. In addition, she provides five especially useful appendixes that address state-by-state resources, legal advocacy, counseling and professional help, signs of emotional illness, and signs of substance abuse and child neglect. Many books address the issue of battered women, but this is perhaps the first that is meant to help those who want to help.

The Ninth Edition features 100 detailed maps and a gallery of big-fish photos (by some of the state&#39;s finest fishing photographers) that will make your casting arm twitch.</p><p>Most Oregon anglers won&#39;t leave home without this book, and most long-time Oregon anglers eagerly anticipate a new edition every five years, including the thoroughly updated &#34;FIO9&#34;. Running 80 pages thicker, the new edtion reflects significant changes in Oregon fishing regulations, updates information about public access to lakes and streams, describes waters newly open to public access, and includes guidance on how to use river level readings (now available on the Web) to choose your fishing destination.It's been raining reliably since 1995, so this edition of Fishing in Oregon reflects the healing power of timely autumn rains, lively spring freshets, and brimming reservoirs. This is a cheerful book for the most part, focusing on appreciation of our state's fishing opportunities. Which are many. It recognizes as facts changes that have occurred in Oregon angling since the last edition was published in 1995. It doesn't blame or lament. Instead, it attempts to provide the information you need to choose where to fish, depending on your fishing preferences and goals. In case you had't noticed, this is no longer the Wild West, and you can't keep everything you catch just because it bites and looks good to eat. If harvest is your aim, use Fishing in Oregon in conjunction with the current angling regulations to hone in on the appropriate fisheries&#x2014;-rivers with strong runs of finclipped hatchery steelhead, finclipped coho, or fall chinook; streams with hatchery trout, a! n over-abundance of brookies, or wild trout but no juvenile steelhead; smallmouth bass and other warmwater species in backwaters and sloughs; rock, bottom, or surf fish; sturgeon or walleye; almost everything that thrives in lakes and reservoirs. We're far from bereft of catch-and-keep opportunities in this state. On the other hand, if you're yearning to fish wild steelhead, wild coho, chum salmon, bull trout, cutthroat on the Northern coast, searun--resign yourself to catch-and-release, and rejoice that they're still here despite years of drought, El Nino, lost habitat, and too many dams. Remember that the chase and the hook-up are the most fun anyway. And when people ask you why you bother to fish if you can't bring it home as fillets, remind them that nobody eats golf balls either!</p><h2>The Maine Poets</h2><p>In The Maine Poets, editor Wesley McNair has selected work by poets of the state from Longfellow to the present.

All authority for any sensei flows from experiments on the gemba [the place where work takes place], not from dogmatic interpretations of sacred texts or the few degrees of separation from the founders of the movement. In short, lean is not a religion but a daily practice of conducting experiments and accumulating knowledge.&#34; So writes Jim Womack, who over the past 30 years has developed a method of going to visit the gemba at countless companies and keenly observing how people work together to create value. Over the past decade, he has shared his thoughts and discoveries from these visits with the Lean Community through a monthly letter. With Gemba Walks, Womack has selected and re-organized his key letters, as well as written new material providing additional context. Gemba Walks shares his insights on topics ranging from the application of specific tools, to the role of management in sustaining lean, as well as the long-term prospects for this fundamental new way of creating value. Reading this book will reveal to readers a range of lean principles, as well as the basis for the critical lean practice of: go see, ask why, and show respect.</p><p></p><h2>The Rudder Treasury: A Companion for Lovers of Small Craft</h2><p>Featuring contributions from some of the most famous and diverse figures in the history of yachting and sailing, from Thomas Fleming Day and C. Andrade Jr. to John Alden and L. Francis Herreshoff, The Rudder Treasury is a timeless record of decades' worth of accumulated experience.<br><br>This volume encompasses some of the best articles ever to appear in the legendary Rudder magazine, the premier nautical publication from the first half of the twentieth century. It contains a treasure trove of influential writings on a varied and exhaustive array of topics. The four sections contain WInter Reading (all sorts of cruising adventures), The Dream Ships (plans and descriptions of various boats by well-known designers), the Care and Feeding of Yachtsmen , and The Hurrah's Nest, a bilgeful of dogmatic advice, arbitrary opinions, and clever devices and methods. This anthology is an invaluable resource, representing a wealth of wisdom unavailable for the past fifty years.</p><p>Tom Davin, Editor, is a writer and sailing enthusiast....a treasure of good writing, good humor and good advice...

(<i>Cruising World</i> 2003-08-01)<br><br>From its launch in 1891 to the middle of the twentieth century, The Rudder was the greatest American yachting and boating magazine , says Peter H. Spectre in his Foreword; high praise from an editor who, to me, personifies the best of current American boating magazines. What made The Rudder so special?...It was edited for years by Thomas Fleming Day...He treated his readers as intelligent human beings... recognized yacht design as an evolution, with a connected past, present and future... of the school that the doing was more important than the having. All of these trace elements and more are present in the selected material which Tom Davin has divided into Winter Reading, mainly cruising yarns; Dream Ships, boats described by the leading designers of their day; the Care and Feeding of Yachtsmen, including recipes for Lobsters and Gin, Whelk Stew-Soup and Conch Salad; and The Hurrah's Nest, a bilgeful of dogmatic advice, arbitrary opinions, and clever devices and methods. <br><br>My only real reservation about recommending this anthology without reservation is that I fear it will spoil you for modern boating magazines, including mine.

And when an <i>isbjorn</i> (polar bear) seeks her out, and promises that her family will become rich if only the Lass will accompany him to his castle, she doesn't hesitate. But the bear is not what he seems, nor is his castle, which is made of ice and inhabited by a silent staff of servents. Only a grueling journey on the backs of the four winds will reveal the truth: the bear is really a prince who's been enchanted by a troll queen, and the Lass must come up with a way to free him before he's forced to marry a troll princess.</p></p><p><p><b>Jessica Day George</b> is the author of <i>Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow</i>, <i>Dragon Slippers</i>, and its sequel, <i>Dragon Flight</i>.

At the palace, she is waited on by an odd assortment of creatures, including salamanders and a selkie, but there are sinister undercurrents beneath the luxury,&nbsp;leading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of horrifying deaths. George has adapted Norse myths and fairy tales to create this eerily beautiful, often terrifying world in which animals talk, trolls marry humans only to destroy them, and weather forces are actual characters. Mystery, adventure, the supernatural, and a touch of love are woven together to create a vivid, well-crafted, poetic fantasy for readers who have enjoyed works by Robin McKinley and Esther Friesner or who are ready to move from Gail Carson Levine&#x2019;s fairy-tale adaptations to more sophisticated fare.

How did they feel about socialism and the acts committed in its name? This unique book provides English- speaking readers with the responses of those who experienced firsthand the events of the middle-Stalinist period. The book contains 157 documents-mostly letters to authorities from Soviet citizens, but also reports compiled by the secret police and Communist Party functionaries, internal government and party memoranda, and correspondence among party officials. Selected from recently opened Soviet archives, these previously unknown documents illuminate in new ways both the complex social roots of Stalinism and the texture of daily life during a highly traumatic decade of Soviet history. Accompanied by introductory and linking commentary, the documents are organized around such themes as the impact of terror on the citizenry, the childhood experience, the countryside after collectivization, and the role of cadres that were directed to &#34;decide everything.&#34; In their own words, peasants and workers, intellectuals and the uneducated, adults and children, men and women, Russians and people from other national groups tell their stories.

She visits the small boy, Diamond, and takes him with her on her journeys, teaching him about herself. Through the eyes of an innocent and yet perceptive child, MacDonald explores North Wind as a way of exploring the place of death in our lives.

He grew up at Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota, where he now lives. He is a graduate of Princeton University. <br>An empty coffin is lowered into a grave behind a half-abandoned housing project called Poverty on an Indian reservation in northern Minnesota. The burial ceremony is for an enigmatic eight-year-old boy named Little, whose entire vocabulary consists of the word you. First novelist Treuer reconstructs Little's biography by allowing Poverty's inhabitants to tell their own life stories in a mosaic of first-person narratives. In the process, we learn the history of Poverty itself, from the turn of the century to the present. Land that was once virgin pine forest has been ruthlessly logged and tilled until it is now a barren, windswept waste, littered with the skeletons of rusting farm machinery. The town's population has been similarly devastated by poverty, alcoholism, and the Vietnam War. Treuer's portrait of a downtrodden people unfolds in slow, carefully measured prose, packed with descriptive detail.

Tolkien to show that the key to the inspiration, magic, and enchantment of Tolkien&#39;s Middle-earth books is language itself</p><p><p>Tom Shippey taught at Oxford University at the same time as J.R.R. Tolkien and with the same syllabus, which gives him an intimate familiarity with the works that fueled Tolkien's imagination. He subsequently held the chair of English language and medieval literature at Leeds University that Tolkien had previously held.</p>PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION<br><br>My involvement with Tolkien"s fiction<br>now goes back almost fifty years, to a <br>first reading of The Hobbit some time in<br>the mid-1950s. My first attempt to <br>comment publicly on Tolkien did not<br>come, however, till late 1969 or early <br>1970, when I was recruited, as a very<br>junior lecturer at the University of <br>Birmingham, to speak on "Tolkien as<br>philologist" at a Tolkien day organised <br>by some now-forgotten association. It<br>was my good fortune that Tolkien"s <br>secretary, Joy Hill, was in the<br>audience, and asked me for a copy of my <br>script to show the Professor. It was my<br>further good fortune that he read it, <br>perhaps out of good will to Birmingham<br>and to King Edward"s School, <br>Birmingham, which we both attended, he<br>(with a gap) from 1900 to 1911, and <br>I from 1954 to 1960. Tolkien furthermore<br>replied to it, with his habitual <br>courtesy, in a letter dated 13 April<br>1970, though it took me a very long time <br>to understand what he meant, as I<br>discuss below.<br> It was not till 1972 that I met Tolkien<br>in person, by which time I <br>had been promoted from Birmingham to a<br>Fellowship at St. John"s College, <br>Oxford, to teach Old and Middle English<br>along the lines which Tolkien had <br>laid down many years before. Just after<br>I arrived in Oxford, Tolkien"s <br>successor in the Merton Chair of English<br>Language, Norman Davis, invited <br>me to dine at Merton and meet Tolkien,<br>who was then living in college <br>lodgings following the death of his<br>wife. The meeting left me with a strong <br>sense of obligation and even<br>professional piety, in the old sense of<br>that word, i.e. "affectionate loyalty and respect,<br>esp. to parents", or in this case <br>predecessors. After Tolkien"s death I<br>felt increasingly that he would not have <br>been happy with many of the things<br>people said about his writings, and that <br>someone with a similar background to his<br>own ought to try to provide&#x2014;as <br>Tolkien and E. V. Gordon wrote in the<br>"Preface" to their 1925 edition of Sir <br>Gawain and the Green Knight&#x2014;"a<br>sufficient apparatus for reading [these <br>remarkable works] with an appreciation<br>as far as possible of the sort which <br>its author may be supposed to have desired".<br> In 1975, accordingly, I contributed an<br>article on "Creation from <br>Philology in The Lord of the Rings" to<br>the volume of Essays in Memoriam <br>edited by Mary Salu and R. T. Farrell,<br>essentially an expansion of my 1970 <br>script. In 1979, however, I followed<br>Tolkien"s track yet again, this time going <br>to the Chair of English Language and<br>Medieval English Literature at the <br>University of Leeds, which Tolkien had<br>held more than fifty years before. This <br>only increased the sense of professional<br>piety mentioned above, and the <br>result was the first edition of the<br>present work, which appeared in 1982. I <br>assumed at the time that that would be<br>my last word on the subject. But <br>since then, of course, the whole<br>"History of Middle-earth" has appeared, <br>twelve volumes of Tolkien"s unpublished<br>drafts and stories edited by his son <br>Christopher, as well as a volume of<br>academic essays including some new <br>material, and the "reconstructed"<br>editions of the Old English Exodus and <br>Finnsburg poems: each separate<br>publication a valuable source of<br>information, but also of some trepidation to the<br>writer who has committed himself to <br>explaining "how Tolkien worked" or "what<br>Tolkien must have been thinking". A <br>second edition of The Road to<br>Middleearth, in 1992, accordingly tried<br>to take some of this material into account.<br> A further thought, however, had slowly<br>been growing upon me, first expressed in the<br>article on "Tolkien as a Post-War Writer", <br>delivered as a lecture at the "Tolkien Phenomenon"<br>conference at the University of Turku, <br>Finland, in 1992, and printed in the<br>proceedings of that conference, <br>Scholarship and Fantasy, edited by Keith<br>J. Battarbee. This thought was that <br>I had from 1970 always thought of<br>Tolkien as a philologist, a professional <br>ancestor, one of a line of historical<br>linguists descended essentially from <br>Jacob Grimm, of "Grimm"s Law" and<br>"Grimms" Fairy Tales". I had in other <br>words habitually seen him, to use the<br>linguists" term, "diachronically". But <br>language can and should also be viewed<br>"synchronically", and so could <br>Tolkien. What happened if one considered<br>him in the literary context of his <br>time, the early to mid-twentieth<br>century? My unconsidered assumption had <br>been that he had no literary context,<br>that he was a "one-off "&#x2014;certainly the <br>impression one would get from reading<br>any literary histories of the period <br>which happened to mention him. But if<br>one reflected on Orwell and William <br>Golding, Vonnegut and T. H. White, C. S.<br>Lewis and even Ursula Le Guin, <br>several of them close to him in age or<br>experience or date of publication, a <br>different picture emerged: one of a<br>group of (as I have called <br>them) "traumatised authors", writing<br>fantasy, but voicing in that fantasy the <br>most pressing and most immediately<br>relevant issues of the whole monstrous <br>twentieth century&#x2014;questions of<br>industrialised warfare, the origin of<br>evil, the nature of humanity. This "synchronic"<br>view of Tolkien took shape in my book <br>J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century<br>(2000). (Grammarians will note the <br>absence of an article before the first<br>word of the sub-title.) I hope that my two <br>books now complement each other through<br>their different approaches, though <br>they present essentially the same<br>explanations of the central works.<br> The present, third edition of The Road<br>to Middle-earth naturally allows and obliges some<br>reconsiderations, especially as a result<br>of the new information contained in "The History of<br>Middle-earth". On the whole I feel my <br>first edition got off relatively lightly, confirmed as often as<br>disproved. The rolling years and volumes have allowed<br>me some clear hits: "angel" as Tolkien-<br>speech for messenger (see note 11 to<br>chapter 5 below, and c.p. Treason of <br>Isengard, p. 422), or the importance of<br>Old Mercian (see below p. 123 and <br>c.p. Sauron Defeated, p. 257). Of course<br>when it comes to philology, a real <br>discipline, one ought to get things<br>right. I was pleased when Anders <br>Stenstr�m, staying with me in Leeds in<br>1984, found in a Leeds journal for <br>1922 an anonymous poem in Middle English<br>which we concluded was by <br>Tolkien; but almost as pleased when the<br>emendations I proposed to the text <br>as (mis)printed were confirmed by<br>Christopher Tolkien from his father"s <br>manuscript (see the journal of the<br>Swedish Tolkien Society, Arda, vols. 4 [for <br>1984] and 6 [for 1986], for the poem and<br>Stenstr�m"s account of his search).<br> Meanwhile, some unmistakable wides have<br>also been called: in <br>my allegorisation of "Leaf by Niggle",<br>on p. 44 below, I should not have <br>written "his "Tree" = The Lord of the<br>Rings", but have put down something <br>much more extensive; despite p. 76,<br>Sauron was not part of <br>Tolkien"s "subsequent inspiration" but<br>there already; while on p. 271, <br>writing "There is, in a way, no more of<br>"middle-earth" to consider" was just <br>tempting Providence. Even more<br>significantly, my 1982 discussion of<br>"depth" in Tolkien, pp. 308&#x2013;17 below, was<br>extensively answered by Christopher <br>Tolkien a year later in his "Foreword"<br>to The Book of Lost Tales, Part 1, pp. 1&#x2013;<br>5, with a further note in Part 2, p. 57.<br>It is clear that all my discussions of <br>Tolkien were affected by reading his<br>works (as almost everyone does) in <br>order of publication, not order of<br>composition. It is a temptation to try to <br>remedy this retrospectively, but I have<br>not done so. Studying Tolkien"s fiction <br>as it developed in his own mind,<br>possible now as it was not in 1982,<br>would be a different book. In general, then, I am<br>happy to stand by what I published in <br>1982, and again in 1992, remembering the<br>data I had, and expanding or <br>updating wherever necessary.<br> Yet I do turn back to the letter<br>Professor Tolkien wrote to me on <br>13 April 1970, charmingly courteous and<br>even flattering as it was from one at <br>the top of his profession to one then at<br>the bottom ("I don"t like to fob people <br>off with a formal thanks . . . one of<br>the nearest to my heart, or the nearest, of <br>the many I have received . . . I am<br>honoured to have received your attention"). <br>And yet, and yet . . . What I should<br>have realised&#x2014;perhaps did half-realise, <br>for I speak the dialect myself&#x2014;was that<br>this letter was written in the <br>specialised politeness-language of Old<br>Western Man, in which doubt and <br>correction are in direct proportion to<br>the obliquity of expression. The <br>Professor"s letter had invisible italics<br>in it, which I now supply. "I amin <br>agreement with nearly all that you say,<br>and I only regret that I have not the <br>time to talk more about your paper:<br>especially about design as it appears or <br>may be found in a large finished work,<br>and the actual events or experiences <br>as seen or felt by the waking mind in<br>the course of actual composition". It <br>has taken me thirty years (and the<br>perusal of fifteen volumes unpublished in <br>1970) to see the point of the italics.<br>Tolkien, however, closed his letter to me <br>with the proverb: "Need brooks no delay,<br>yet late is better than never?" I can <br>only repeat his saying, question-mark<br>and all.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Tom Shippey.<br>Reprinted by permission of Houghton <br>Mifflin Company.</p><h2>The General: Charles De Gaulle and the France He Saved</h2><p>No leader of modern times was more uniquely patriotic than Charles de Gaulle. As founder and first president of the Fifth Republic, General de Gaulle saw himself as &#x201c;carrying France on [his] shoulders.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>In his twenties, he fought for France in the trenches and at the epic battle of Verdun. In the 1930s, he waged a lonely battle to enable France to better resist Hitler&#x2019;s Germany. Thereafter, he twice rescued the nation from defeat and decline by extraordinary displays of leadership, political acumen, daring, and bluff, heading off civil war and leaving a heritage adopted by his successors of right and left.<br><br>&nbsp;Le G�n�ral, as he became known from 1940 on, appeared as if he was carved from a single monumental block, but was in fact extremely complex, a man with deep personal feelings and recurrent mood swings, devoted to his family and often seeking reassurance from those around him. This is a magisterial, sweeping biography of one of the great leaders of the twentieth century and of the country with which he so identified himself.

In this endlessly entertaining follow-up to his bestselling social history <i>740 Park</i>, Gross pulls back the shades of secrecy that have long shrouded the upper class&#x2019;s cultural and philanthropic ambitions and maneuvers. And he paints a revealing portrait of a previously hidden face of American wealth and power.<br><br>The Metropolitan, Gross writes, &#x201c;is a huge alchemical experiment, turning the worst of man&#x2019;s attributes&#x2014;extravagance, lust, gluttony, acquisitiveness, envy, avarice, greed, egotism, and pride&#x2014;into the very best, transmuting deadly sins into priceless treasure.&#x201d; The book covers the entire 138-year history of the Met, focusing on the museum&#x2019;s most colorful characters. Opening with the lame-duck director Philippe de Montebello, the museum&#x2019;s longest-serving leader who finally stepped down in 2008, <i>Rogues&#x2019; Gallery</i> then goes back to the very beginning, highlighting, among many others: the first director, Luigi Palma di Cesnola, an Italian-born epic phony, whose legacy is a trove of plundered ancient relics, some of which remain on display today; John Pierpont Morgan, the greatest capitalist and art collector of his day, who turned the museum from the plaything of a handful of rich amateurs into a professional operation dedicated, sort of, to the public good; John D. Rockefeller Jr., who never served the Met in any official capacity but who, during the Great Depression, proved the only man willing and rich enough to be its benefactor, which made him its behind-the-scenes puppeteer; the controversial Thomas Hoving, whose tenure as director during the sixties and seventies revolutionized museums around the world but left the Met in chaos; and Jane Engelhard and Annette de la Renta, a mother-daughter trustee tag team whose stories will astonish you (think <i>Casablanca</i> rewritten by Edith Wharton).<br><br>With a supporting cast that includes artists, forgers, and looters, financial geniuses and scoundrels, museum officers (like its chairman Arthur Amory Houghton, head of Corning Glass, who once ripped apart a priceless and ancient Islamic book in order to sell it off piecemeal), trustees (like Jayne Wrightsman, the Hollywood party girl turned society grand dame), curators (like the aging Dietrich von Bothmer, a refugee from Nazi Germany with a Bronze Star for heroism whose greatest acquisitions turned out to be looted), and donors (like Irwin Untermyer, whose collecting obsession drove his wife and children to suicide), and with cameo appearances by everyone from <i>Vogue </i>editors Anna Wintour and Diana Vreeland to Sex Pistols front man Johnny Rotten, <i>Rogues&#x2019; Gallery</i> is a rich, satisfying, alternately hilarious and horrifying look at America&#x2019;s upper class, and what is perhaps its greatest creation.</p></p><p><p>Provocative cultural journalist and <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author <b>Michael Gross</b> is currently a<i> </i>contributing editor at <i>Travel &amp; Leisure</i>.

He currently lives in New York City.</p>On a chilly winter day, early in 2006, I sat in the office of Philippe de Montebello, then director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (he would announce his retirement two years later). Montebello is generally considered, even by his most fervent admirers, a little arrogant, a touch on the pompous side, and his mid-Atlantic Voice of God (well-known from his Acoustiguide tours of exhibitions) does nothing to dispel the impression of a healthy self-regard. So I was nervous; I was there to discuss my plan to write an unauthorized book about the museum and to ask for his support, or, at least, his neutrality. <br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t happy to see me. <br><br>Ever since its founding, the Metropolitan has bred arrogance, hauteur, hubris, vanity and even madness in those who live in proximity to its multitude of treasures and who have come to feel not just protective but possessive of them. &#x201c;Being involved with it made you special to the outside world,&#x201d; says Stuart Silver, for years the museum&#x2019;s chief exhibition designer. &#x201c;It was a narcotic. You were high all the time.&#x201d; <br>The Metropolitan is more than a mere drug, though. It is a huge alchemical experiment, turning the worst of man&#x2019;s attributes&#x2014;extravagance, lust, gluttony, acquisitiveness, envy, avarice, greed, egotism and pride&#x2014;into the very best, transmuting deadly sins into priceless treasure. So the museum must be seen as something separate from the often imperfect individuals who created it, who sustained it and who run it today, something greater than the sum of their myriad flaws. <br><br>Without taking anything away from The Louvre or the Orsay in Paris, Madrid&#x2019;s Prado, St. Petersburg&#x2019;s Hermitage, The British Museum (which has no pictures), Britain&#x2019;s National Gallery (which has only pictures and sculpture), the Vatican in Rome, the Uffizi in Florence, Vienna&#x2019;s Kunsthistoriches Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, Berlin&#x2019;s Pergamon, Amsterdam&#x2019;s Rijksmuseum, the Smithsonian Institute and its National Gallery of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Getty in Malibu or other vital New York museums like the Whitney, the Guggenheim, and the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan is simply (and at the same time not at all simply) the most encyclopedic, universal art museum in the world. <br><br>In Montebello&#x2019;s office that day, he&#x2019;d been slumped sullenly in his chair as I made my pitch, but straightened up as I finished. &#x201c;You are laboring under a misimpression,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;The museum has no secrets.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>From its inception, oversized personalities have dominated the Metropolitan; many loom large in American history, too. John Jay, grandson of the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, first conceived of it. William Cullen Bryant, the orator, poet, journalist, publisher and club man was one of the most eloquent advocates of the museum&#x2019;s creation. In recent times, its board heads have been some of America&#x2019;s most powerful men: in the 1930s, George Blumenthal, who headed Lazard Fr�res; in the 1960s, C. Douglas Dillon, John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s Secretary of the Treasury; in the 1970s, Robert Lehman, the head of Lehman Brothers and in the 1980s, Arthur Ochs &#x201c;Punch&#x201d; Sulzberger, the chairman of <i>The New York Times</i>. <br><br>Some of these characters defined distinct eras in the museum&#x2019;s colorful history. Luigi Palma di Cesnola, named the first director by the mostly self-made founders, was an Italian count, a Civil War veteran given to inflating his rank, an American diplomat and an amateur archaeologist, some of whose finds from Cyprus remain treasures in the museum&#x2019;s collections today; his excesses mark it still. J. Pierpont Morgan is credited with turning the Met from a semi-private clubhouse for the trustees into a professional operation. <br><br>Following Morgan and dominating throughout the mid-20th century, though never serving as a trustee or officer, John D. Rockefeller Jr. was quietly its greatest benefactor and his relationship with James Rorimer, the sixth director, was a model for the symbiosis between the rich and the scholarly that made the Met blossom even more after Morgan. Hoving, a scholar but also a showman like Cesnola, was appointed by a board of trustees led by a group of gun-slinging veterans of John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s New Frontier administration; he re-invented the Met, and in the process redefined all museums during his mere ten years as director, beginning in 1966. <br><br>Ever since the beginning, the Met has been a political, cultural and social spectacle, especially when all three come together in the cauldron of fundraising. Then the fun really begins. You can get a seat on the board by wielding power (like Henry Kissinger, who was recruited to lend geopolitical savvy), or waving your family bloodline or corporate flag (among the Met&#x2019;s brand-name trustee dynasties have been Morgans, Astors, Whitneys, Rockefellers, Annenbergs, Houghtons and various representatives of the Lazard Fr�res investment bank) or possessing a useful skill (like any number of financiers, developers and the media titans Reid, Luce, and Sulzberger). But money counts most of all: a commitment to donate six figure sums every year, or to twist the arms of other potential givers. &#x201c;Give, get, or get out,&#x201d; is the rule. <br>&nbsp;<br>Back in Philippe de Montebello&#x2019;s office, I wound up my pitch for the museum&#x2019;s cooperation... and left the room shortly after with the distinct feeling that I was on my own. For I already knew that a curtain of secrecy had been hung over the museum long before Montebello&#x2019;s time. With the stakes so high and the money and egos involved so big, the Met has always had to operate in the shade, whether it was acquiring art under questionable circumstances, dealing with donors hoping to launder very sketchy reputations, or merely trying to appear above reproach in a world where behind almost every painting is a fortune and behind that, a sin or a crime. The Metropolitan Museum is a storehouse of human memory. But it appeared, that day at least, it would just as soon its own be erased.</p><h2>The Epistle to the Hebrews;: From ritual to reality</h2><p>DUST JACKET HAS SOME TEARS, DINGS, SCUFFING &amp; EDGE WEAR.

Smith is often misrepresented in the public imagination as a cold, calculating rationalist espousing the pursuit of self-interest in the marketplace of laissez-faire capitalism, regardless of the human cost. This grossly inaccurate portrait may go back to Karl Marx, who seems not to have read Smith&#39;s work very carefully and thus criticized him as an unfeeling advocate of a system that exploited and alienated workers.The Theory of Moral Sentiments, however, clearly demonstrates that besides mundane economic pursuits, Smith was just as interested, if not more so, in the capacity of people to bestow and to esteem benevolence, and to strive for virtue even while they are pursuing their own self-interest. The root of our motivation to act benevolently toward others, says Smith, is our natural propensity to sympathize with others. By the same token, our need to have others sympathize with us fuels our desire to be esteemed by others for our benevolence and generally virtuous character. But beyond the need for social approbation, we also have a genuine desire to live according to the dictates of conscience (called by Smith the &#34;Impartial Spectator&#34;). This is our highest impulse and leads us continually to strive for excellence in all spheres of life quite apart from any recognition or encouragement from others. It may be prudent in our economic life to follow our self-interest to secure the basic necessities, but this is only the first stage of personal development toward the much higher goal of living a morally virtuous life.Although The Theory of Moral Sentiments is not well known today, it was widely read and highly praised by the leading intellectuals of the day including David Hume and Edmund Burke. The book went through six different editions between 1759 and 1790 and was also translated into French by the widow of Condorcet. To gain a complete picture of Adam Smith and his ideas, every reader of The Wealth of Nations should also become familiar with his classic treatment of ethics.</p><p>Adam Smith&#39;s Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) lays the foundation for a general system of morals, and is a text of central importance in the history of moral and political thought. By means of the idea of sympathy and the mental construct of an impartial spectator, Smith formulated highly original theories of conscience, moral judgment and the virtues. This volume offers a new edition of the text with helpful notes for the student reader, together with a substantial introduction that sets the work in its philosophical and historical context.&#34;In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith assigned himself a difficult and dangerous task: to establish for educated men in an increasingly revolutionary age the reasonableness of morality and the necessity of the fruits of virtue - illustrated by the wisdom of the classical authors of antiquity. This book, Adam Smith&#39;s first, is, then, proof to skeptics of the importance of morality; and an antidote to those who think that free-market economics can be divorced from a moral society.&#34;--BOOK JACKET.</p><h2>Watch the Skies!: A Chronicle of the Flying Saucer Myth</h2><p>Narrates the belief in alien visitors to the earth since the 1940s, when their spacecraft began to be described consistently as saucer shaped. Discusses the various divisions and feuds within the movement, its evolution through the decades, and its relation to believers&#39; beliefs about the government, military, and other aspects of society. A debunking rather than a sociological study. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>It&#39;s not your typical UFO book, though it is full of contactees, conspiracy plots, and cattle mutilations. With an in-depth, although skeptical scrutiny of the UFO phenomenon, Peebles doesn&#39;t address every case but tackles the most widely quoted incidents from Kenneth Arnold&#39;s sighting of flying disks in the &#39;40s through the abduction trends of the early &#39;90s. While the book is biased, Peebles&#39; research is impeccable, and he brings to light facts which many pro-UFO authors tend to neglect.The phrase flying saucer didn't come along until 1947, and since then it has come to connote many things in the sky people don't understand. Peebles ( The Moby Dick Project , Smithsonian, 1991) has compiled a splendid history of this modern myth. After a brief overview of the distant past, he begins an exhaustive and convincing study of the phenomena. "The flying saucer myth is a mirror to the events of post-war America--the paranoia of the 1950s, the social turmoil of the 1960s, the 'me generation' of the 1970s, and the nihilism of the 1980s and the early 1990s. As the flying saucer myth entered popular culture, images and ideas were created that, in turn, shaped the flying saucer myth itself." Peebles makes his case admirably. He gives a history of practically every major UFO case since 1947, along with a discussion of the investigation and the probable correct explanation. A thoroughly excellent book; recommended for all libraries.<br><i>- Dave Summers, Holly Twp.

Robert Service, one of our finest historians of modern Russia, sets out to examine the history of communism throughout the world. His uncomfortable conclusion - and an important message for the twenty-first century is that although communism in its original form is now dead or dying, the poverty and injustice that enabled its rise are still dangerously alive. Unsettling, compellingly written and brilliantly argued, this is a superb work of history and one that demands to be read. &#39;Bears all the hallmarks of a classic work of historical literature the true international legacy of communism [is] analyzed to magisterial effect in this exhilarating work&#39; Hwyel Williams New Statesman &#39;One of the best-ever studies of the subject a remarkable accomplishment&#39; Economist &#39;An outstanding book, written with grace and style&#39; Daily Telegraph &#39;[A] brilliantly distilled world history of communism Confronted by Service&#39;s amazing array of evidence to show that communism could only ever have flourished under conditions of extreme and all-pervasive oppression, only the determinedly soft-headed would try to argue with him&#39; Craig Brown, Mail on Sunday</p><p>Robert Service is the author of the highly acclaimed Lenin: A Biography, A History of Twentieth-Century Russia, Russia: Experiment with a People and Stalin: A Biography, as well as many other books on Russia&#39;s past and present. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and of St Antony&#39;s College, Oxford. He is married with four children.In this incisive study, Service (<i>A History of Modern Russia</i>) surveys the varieties of communist ideologies (from Marx to Marcuse) and regimes (the Soviet Union getting the lion's share of attention) and finds a coherent pattern, which he forthrightly labels totalitarianism. Communism's hallmarks, he argues, include violent dictatorships, rigid, all-encompassing states that shackle civil society, persecute religion and stifle individual freedom. Communist systems impose dowdy fashions and stagnant economies staffed by listless workers. Rather than historical vagaries, Service contends, these are necessary features of communism, rooted in Marxist-Leninist doctrine and essential to regimes that needed suffocating repression to keep a lid on popular discontent. Service's critique is overwhelmingly negative, with scathing portraits of Communist leaders, intellectuals and fellow travelers like Sidney and Beatrice Webb, whom he calls "Stalin's admiring slugs." Yet he manages to be fair; he calmly exposes crimes of Communist regimes, nods at their achievements (especially those of local Communist administrations in India and Western Europe) and smiles at the poetic neocommunism of Mexico's Subcommandante Marcos. In his fluent narrative style, Service covers a lot of ground, sometimes too cursorily; the book could use more statistics, especially on the performance of Communist economies. Still, though bound to be controversial, his is an engaging and useful introduction to a world-shaking movement. 24 b&amp;w photos. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Using both Spanish and English words to tally the party preparations, Grandma Beetle cleverly delays her trip and spends her birthday with a table full of grandchildren and her surprise guest. This spirited tribute to the rich traditions of Mexican culture is the perfect introduction to counting in both English and Spanish. The vivacious illustrations and universal depiction of a family celebration are sure to be adored by young readers everywhere.</p><p>Yuyi Morales is an artist, a Brazilian folk dancer, a puppet maker and the former host of a Spanish-language storytelling radio show for children. She grew up in Mexico and now lives with her husband, son and cat in Northern California.Winking and nodding as she goes, a Latino grandmother will charm readers as she charms Death Himself in this original counting-cum-trickster tale. When skeletal Senor Calavera appears at the door, Grandma Beetle bids him wait while she sweeps ONE house ('UNO'), makes TWO pots of tea ('DOS'), grinds THREE pounds of corn for tortillas ('TRES'), and so on, culminating in a festive birthday party at which Senor Calavera finds himself guest number TEN ('DIEZ'). As Grandma, round and brown, with sparkles in her eyes and gray hair both, bustles about, the expression on Senor Calavera's sugar-skull face grows more and more hilariously impatient -- but by party's end, he's departed, leaving a thank-you note promising to be back for Grandma Beetle's next birthday. Lit with dancing lines and warm colors, Morales' illustrations enhance the appeal of this winning story even further. - <b>Kirkus Reviews, starred review</b> <p>What's an old woman to do when a skeleton pays her a birthday visit and beckons her to "come along"? Grandma Beetle, the heroine of this joyful book by the illustrator of Harvesting Hope, stalls for time. "Just a minute," she says; there's something she needs to do. One chore leads to another, but the skeleton can't mask his enthusiasm as Grandma cooks, fills pinatas, and performs other tasks, each one linked to a number from 1 to 10, uno to diez. Eventually nueve grandchildren arrive for Grandma's birthday party, and guess who else is invited? Even if children don't grasp the implications of the skeleton's visit, they'll enjoy seeing him join the fun, and when he extends Grandma's lease on life, the relieved, loving embrace she gives her grandchildren will satisfy young ones at a gut level. Like the text, the rich, lively artwork draws strongly upon Mexican culture, with hints of Diego Rivera in Grandma's robust form, and the skeleton resembling the whimsical figurines often seen in Day of the Dead folk art. Along with their useful math and multicultural elements, the splendid art and spiritual storytelling auger a long, full life for this original folktale. - <b>Booklist, starred review</b><br><br>Winking and nodding as she goes, a Latino grandmother will charm readers as she charms Death Himself in this original counting-cum-trickster tale...<strong>Kirkus Reviews</strong></p></p><h2>Sweet Paul Eat and Make: Charming Recipes and Kitchen Crafts You Will Love</h2><p>It began as a little blog highlighting the recipes and crafts of&nbsp;the Norwegian-born food and prop stylist Paul Lowe.

Shannon is a veteran of hospitals and treatments and Francesca is newly diagnosed. The novel is told in two voices in free verse poetry; a line down the center of the page indicates their separation by a hospital room curtain, and the poems are meant to be read across the curtain rather than down each column, which may take readers time to decipher. The poetic stylization of the novel is satisfactory, giving readers quick, emotion-soaked impressions, but makes the plot difficult to follow at first. The character development for both girls is somewhat tenuous; Chessa's voice is the stronger of the two, and we learn she is hiding a horrible secret. Shannon's voice is much less developed, which makes it hard to know and empathize with her. The poetic style of the novel may be attractive to readers who are intimidated by a hefty page count.

When her family moved to Boston, she continued to study ballet and was totally inspired when she saw a performance by Maya Plisetskaya of the Bolshoi Ballet.

Her promising future came to an end at the age of 18 when she suffered a serious ankle injury. However, rather than focusing on this disappointment, Siegel notes that she went on to college and later began dancing again because, Dancing fills a space in me. The graphic format works well. The illustrations and story line blend together to create a pleasing whole. The watercolor-and-ink illustrations introduce a theme of fluidity and movement through undulating ribbons like those on a ballerina's slippers. Through one dancer's experiences during the 1970s and '80s, readers are introduced to an important period in the world of ballet and are given an inspiring message about the dedication required to become a ballerina.<i>&#x2013;Carol Schene, formerly at Taunton Public Schools, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nora Ray begins to think that there are political forces trying to cover up the truth of what really took place</p><p>Luke Garrison, a former D.A. who has abandoned the problematic morality of convincing juries to send criminals to the gas chamber, first appeared in <i>The Disappearance</i>, in which his old mentor wanted Luke to take on a sensational murder case that had the entire country abuzz. In <i>Above the Law</i>, J.F. Freedman continues to apply a successful formula: reluctant hero takes on a case that nobody, but nobody, wants. This time out, Nora Ray, the D.A. of Muir County, the least populated and poorest county in California--and a friend from Luke's law school days--asks Luke to help her investigate a recent police killing, which she believes may be a monumental government coverup. <p> The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has swaggered, guns blazing, into the forests near the White Horse reservation, intent on raiding the fortress-like retreat of Reynaldo Juarez, the notoriously reclusive leader of one of the biggest drug-dealing gangs in the country. Janet Reno herself has determined that he must be taken alive, so when the raid is blown, four DEA agents are killed, and Juarez himself dies <i>after</i> being taken into custody, questions and recriminations are par for the course. Nora and Luke must negotiate local hostility and pitched interdepartmental acrimony as they slowly unravel the tangled stories that surround the fiasco. But as he casts his investigative gaze from the poverty of the nearby reservation to the depths of the L.A. ghettos, Luke may be dangerously blind to the nearness of immediate treachery and deceit.</p><p> Freedman's strength is Luke's weakness: plagued by fears of failure, haunted by his decision to put job before family, Luke is an appealingly flawed narrator. While Freedman's engaging voice may not completely conceal his occasionally turgid prose, or his tendency to rely on coincidence as the shortest distance between two conundrums, it should be a sufficient siren's call to his loyal fans and those looking for a legal procedural with a conscience. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p><b>J.F.

From Sean Comb's birth in the projects to his life as a devoted father, from the phenomenal success of his multiplatinum debut album No Way Out to the founding of his Daddy House charity and his latest business ventures, A FAMILY AFFAIR reveals how this sexy, enterprising talent minted the hot genre known as "hip-hop soul" and created a multimillion dollar empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since my children are about the same age as Puff Daddy, I was only marginally familiar with the rap/hip-hop music industry. I had heard all the bad stuff and very little of the good. As a person involved in my community and in particularly with young people, I decided to check out Sean "Puffy" Combs and get the "411" on what that scene is all about. I found this an extremely informative look at not only the young life of Sean Combs, but of the ins and outs of the hip-hop/rap music scene for the last ten years. While we find in these pages some of the violence and negative images that the media is so fond of focusing on, we also find a group of young, enterprising, African American entrepreneurs doing it "the American way" with hard work and sacrifice.

Roughly eight million <br>people called one of the five boroughs of New York City home during that <br>decade, and despite the know-it-all attitudes that characterizes many Big <br>Apple residents, most know the city's famous uptown neighborhood only <br>through its reputation as a dangerous urban battleground.<br><br>Admittedly, Harlem had its share of problems at that time, especially <br>overcrowding--almost half a million people, predominantly <br>African-Americans, living in an area of six square miles. Many of the <br>buildings in Harlem had been erected in the early part of the century and <br>housed for far more tenants than they were designed for. A number of these <br>tenements were turned into rooming houses, with each room split into a <br>different apartment, often sheltering a whole family. The conditions in <br>such buildings were--well, less than ideal. There were also smaller <br>houses, brownstones intended for single families (but often rented out to <br>more), and newer apartment buildings designated as developments or housing <br>projects.<br><br>Like all but the wealthiest denizens of New York City, the people of <br>Harlem had to contend with smells of garbage, the constant noise of <br>wailing sirens and traffic, and the ceaseless flow of people. But many <br>wonderful historical events had also taken place in the community across <br>110th Street, which borders the top of Central Park. The Harlem <br>Renaissance of the 1920s made international celebrities of important <br>artists like poet Langston Hughes. The famous Cotton Club was a landmark <br>of the Appollo jazz age, and today, the celebrated Appollo theatre still <br>hosts many of the city's greatest musical shows. And Harlem has never hurt <br>for home grown talent, having nurtured diverse icons from wing <br>bandleader/composer Duke Ellington to the first commercially succesful rap <br>group, Sugar Hill Gang ("Rapper Delight")<br><br>This is the environment into which Sean "Puffy" Combs, the first of <br>Melvin and Janice Combs two children was born in 1970. His mother had made <br>a name for herself with her beautiful looks and poise. Now she was <br>parlaying her attractiveness into a budding modeling career. Since like <br>often attracts likes, small wonder that she and Melvin were drawn to each <br>other. He was a popular and well-liked guy in the neighborhood, with <br>charisma that rivaled Janices own. It wasn't long before they hooked up <br>romantically.<br><br>According to Janice, she was introduced to Melvin at a party in the <br>Bronx. She made no bones about the fact that he lived by the codes of the <br>street and engaged in activities of questionable legality to make a <br>living. But Melvin also had a playful side and loved to dance. Janice and <br>her friends often poked fun at him, because he was so proud of his fancy <br>footwork and fly gear.<br><br>Young Sean's memories of his father would be few. There were flashes he <br>could recall, affectionate gestures like his daddy tossing him in the air <br>and catching him on his third birthday party. But these precious few were <br>the only recollections he would have had a chance to accumulate. In 1973, <br>shortly after Janice gave birth to a second child, Melvin died. Sean was <br>just three years old. For many years he believed that his father had been <br>killed in an auto accident. It wasn't until he was in his teens that he <br>discovered the truth.<br><br>Childhood in Harlem had taught Sean about the realities of life on the <br>urban streets. The Combs's were the only family around who had owned a <br>Mercedes Benz, and as an adolescent, Sean began to observe disparities <br>between the event--as he knew them--surrounding his father's death and <br>stories other people told back in the previous decade. Sean began to <br>suspect his father hadn't been the most conventional of breadwinners.<br><br>He went to the library and began rooting around to find the news of the <br>day when his father died back in 1973. He soon learned that his father's <br>death hadn't been as innocent as he'd been led to believe. There had been <br>a fair share of ink devoted to Melvin Comb's demise at the time, for while <br>running around on Central Park West, he'd been shot in the head.<br><br>Sean took this new knowledge of his real heritage in stride. His father <br>had lived by the codes of the street, and died by them, too. The nature of <br>the shadowy order in the ghettos was such that few men stayed at the top <br>of the totem pole for long, and Sean understood that a shift in supremacy <br>wasn't unusual. The important thing was, even though events surrounding <br>his father's death were different than he'd been led to believe, his dad's <br>character wasn't. Perhaps he'd been running numbers or selling drugs to <br>pay the bills, but people still remembered Melvin Combs as a good man. He <br>certainly wasn't a gangster. A hustler, maybe, but one with a heart.<br><br>Until he turned twelve, Sean lived with his grandmother in one of <br>countless government subsidized housing developments. What with a gorgeous <br>mother and showboating father, he'd inherited a bug for show business, <br>and would model as a baskin robbins ice-cream boy while still in his youth.<br><br>Meanwhile he was turning into a budding entreprenauer as well. Like many <br>kids in the neighborhood, he enlisted to be a paperboy. Every kid was <br>allowed to have only one single delivery route. Sean got a bunch of his <br>cronies to sign up for routes of their own, then bought them out and took <br>over so he'd be earning income from multiple routes.<br><br>But he had his scruples. A devout catholic, he attended church regularly <br>and became an altar boy. He thanked his grandmother for emphasizing the <br>role of God in his life. He admired the fact that God loved everybody, and <br>he tried to follow suit. "Whether you're Catholic, Protestant, white, <br>black, gay, straight, [God's] going to love you [because] that's all he <br>knows," Combs would remark years later in <i>Vox</i> magazine.<br><br>His grandmother's apartment wasn't in the roughest of neighborhoods, but <br>Sean still learned to be tough early on. On one occasion, his grandmother <br>sent him down to the store to buy her a pack of cigarettes. Another kid <br>approached him and demanded that Sean turn over the money he was carrying. <br>Thinking he was tough enough to stand his ground, Sean refused to turn <br>over the cash and put up his dukes.<br><br>The fight didn't last long. Sean's assailant punched him in his handsome <br>mug a few times and walked off with the prize. That day, young Combs <br>learned a valuable lesson that would serve him well: don't get into a <br>fight if you don't think you're going to come out on the winning side. But <br>he also realized something essential about his own character. Despite the <br>pummeling he'd taken, Sean didn't back down and throw in the towel. He was <br>a born fighter, willing to take his licks for something he believed in.<br><br>He counted his mother, who succesfully raised him and his younger sister <br>without remarrying, and boxing legend Muhammed Ali as his idols. So it <br>hardly comes as a surprise that while he continues to get into scrapes <br>with other boys, Sean learned how to deal with them better.<br><br>One day he came home and cried to his mother that another kid had battered <br>him and made off with his skateboard. His mother turned him around and <br>told him he had to march back outside and retrieve his skateboard--even if <br>it meant he had to use physical force--before he could come back into the <br>house. She was just reinforcing an important belief Sean had already <br>become familiar with: If you're going to be a survivor, you can't be <br>afraid to fight for the things you hold dear.<br><br>But the resourceful preteen had also learned from earlier beatings. He <br>didn't go back and get into a fight with his persecutor himself; he <br>enlisted an older, bigger boy exact justice on his behalf. Early on, he <br>was growing to appreciate the advantages of a bustling circle of loved <br>ones and acquaintances.<br><br>Although Janice also owned a home in the community of Mount Vernon, New <br>York, she opted not to raise her children there. Atleast not immediatley. <br>Years later Sean would appreciate her decision. Janice didn't want her <br>children to start their lives in the relative comfort of the suburbs, for <br>growing up in Harlem would imbue them with resilience and resourcefulness <br>that comes from a childhood in the city. But strength wasn't the only <br>asset young Sean would acquire on the streets of Harlem.<br><br><b>The Roots of Hip-Hop</b><br><br>As in any significant art or culture movement, it is impossible to narrow <br>the origins of the music known as hip-hop down to a single person or <br>geographic region. A number of early pioneers can rightfully stake a claim <br>to being the inventor of the genre; Kool DJ Herc, Lovebug Starski, <br>Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, and many others.<br><br>During the seventies, disco was the sound of urban America. And in New <br>York, Pete DJ Jones was the premier disc jockey mixing records with <br>flawless execution, maintaining a constant beat for dancing. Meanwhile an <br>MC--JT Hollywood and Lovebug Starski among the earliest--kept the crowd <br>pumping with call-and-response chants and exhortations to have a good time.<br><br>But teenagers in poorer neighborhoods like Harlem and the South Bronx <br>didn't have the cash and threads required to hear the likes of Pete DJ <br>Jones spinning the pricey mid- or downtown Manhattan clubs like Justine's <br>McCoys, and Nell Gwynn's. So they improvised. The requirements were <br>simple: a pair of turntables, some records, a mic, and a cheap PA system. <br>House and block parties sprang up throughout New York ghettos; power was <br>often jacked by plugging into streetlights. A legion of neighborhood DJs <br>...</p><h2>In Country</h2><p>Vietnam&#39;s moral fallout is revealed to &#34;Sam&#34; Hughes, an eighteen-year-old Kentucky girl whose father was killed in the war and whose Uncle Emmett may be suffering from Agent Orange</p><p>Bobbie Ann Mason has won the PEN/Hemingway Award and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the American Book Award, and the PEN/Faulkner Award. Her books include <i> In Country</i> and <i> Feather Crowns.</i> She lives in Kentucky.YA Sam, 17, is obsessed with the Vietnam War and the effect it has had on her lifelosing a father she never knew and now living with Uncle Emmett, who seems to be suffering from the effects of Agent Orange. In her own forthright way, she tries to sort out why and how Vietnam has altered the lives of the vets of Hopewell, Kentucky. Her untempered curiosity and imagination sprint off in all directions as she examines closely the often undiscussed, but always noticed, aspects of daily life. In this coming-of-age novel, Sam ponders many problems, among them Emmett's crusty, salve-covered pimples, veteran Tom's inability to have an erection and her good friend Dawn's pregnancy. Although Sam lives in a disheveled, tawdry house, she brings a freshness of spirit to the way she scrutinizes and revels in life. When she wants to understand living conditions in the Vietnam jungles, she decides she has to experience it, so spends the night beside a local swamp. A harshly realistic, well-written look at the Vietnam War as well as the story of a young woman maturing.

Evoking his own experience of cancer, he perceives the camps as a tumor that, in mestastasizing, infected the whole nation with its poison..Solzhenitsyn believes that the individual, armed with Truth and Right alone, can move tyrants, subvert power and alter the course of history.</p><p>"Best Nonfiction Book of the Twentieth Century" -- <i>Time magazine</i></p><h2>500 Paleo Recipes: Hundreds of Delicious Recipes for Weight Loss and Super Health</h2><p><p>At last, here is a comprehensive cookbook to the hottest eating plan around!

A dirt road leads to the greenery. Royal palms line the way, cathedral pillars vaulting into a canopy.<br><br>A fuzzy, neon-green hot dog slithers across my path. I start taking photographs of the creature&#x2013;a giant millipede&#x2013;as it undulates toward a plastic orange trash can warping in the heat. Getting deeper into the garden, I come upon the bust of some forgotten botanist, a droplet of tree sap trickling down his forehead like a misplaced tear.<br><br>I rest on a bench near a lagoon strewn with lily pads. The silhouette of Cristo Redentor looms down from the summit of Mount Corcovado. Rio isn&#x2019;t quite the fantasyland of Bossa Nova melodies and paradisiacal seascapes I had envisioned. Homeless kids sleep facedown on Ipanema&#x2019;s wavy mosaic boardwalks. Blue smoke curls over rivulets of shantytown sewage. The only good photograph I&#x2019;ve taken is of a black dog lying on the beach at dusk, an ominous canine stain surrounded by white sand, turquoise water and a purple-pink twilight.<br><br>I try to not think about home. My grandfather just died. My parents&#x2019; marriage is dissolving. A loved one&#x2019;s manic depression is spiraling into a gruesome battle with addiction. My best friend, recovering from a suicide attempt, has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. To top it all off, my girlfriend of eight years is spending New Year&#x2019;s in Europe with her new lover, a French soldier.<br><br>I hear a mocking cackle in the foliage above, and spy a couple of toucans kissing each other&#x2019;s Technicolor beaks. Suddenly, a nearby tree shakes with commotion. Two ring-tailed, white-whiskered monkeys are playing tag. After a momentary stare-down, one of the monkeys plunges through the air into another tree. Zooming in through my viewfinder, I notice something odd: the branches appear to be sprouting bran muffins.<br><br>I pick one of the muffins off the ground. It&#x2019;s brown and woody. It feels like it was baked in a buttered tray at 350 degrees for two hours too long. Not only is the muffin rock hard, it&#x2019;s also hollowed out, as though someone had flipped it over and scooped out its insides. The shell&#x2019;s interior bears scratch marks and a couple of fibrous veins. I wonder what was once inside these empty confections.<br><br>A plaque identifies the tree as a sapucaia. In season, the cupcakes grow packed with a half dozen seeds shaped like orange segments. At ripeness, these burst through the base, scattering on the ground. Impatient young monkeys sometimes punch into an unripe muffin and wrap their fingers around a fistful of nuts. Because their cognitive faculties are not developed enough to understand that extracting their paws requires letting go of the nuts, they end up dragging their sapucaia handcuffs around for miles.<br>In English, these sapucaias are called paradise nuts, an appellation dating back to the European discovery of the New World, then considered the site of heaven. In the sixteenth century, France&#x2019;s Jean de Lery became convinced that he had found Eden in a Brazilian pineapple patch. In 1560, Portuguese explorer Rui Pereira announced that Brazil was officially paradise on earth.<br><br>If I can&#x2019;t find paradise in Brazil, maybe I can find some paradise nuts instead. I head to a small grocery market outside the park. Any sapucaias? The cashier shakes his head, but offers me a Brazil nut, which he says is similar. Biting into it, I&#x2019;m amazed at how creamy and coconutty it is compared to those impossible-to-open monstrosities that lurked in childhood Christmas nut bowls.<br><br>Oversized pineapples, melons and clusters of bananas hang from the ceiling in mesh netting. I pick up a cashew apple, which looks a lot like an angry red pepper capped with a crescent-shaped nut. The green cambucis resemble miniature B-movie flying saucers. The billiard-ball-sized guavas are so fragrant that the ones I buy perfume my hotel room for the rest of my stay.<br>Heading toward the beach, I eat my way through a shopping bag full of the salesman&#x2019;s untranslatable recommendations. Sinking my teeth into one of the scarlet pearlike jambos makes me think of crunching on refreshingly sweet Styrofoam. The transparent gummy flesh of a lemon-shaped abiu tastes like a cross between wine gums and the cr�me caramels served in French bistros back home. A machete-toting coconut vendor, noticing my tentative nibbling of a maracuj�&#x2019;s bitter skin, slices the orb in half and shows me how to slurp up the lavender-fruit-punch viscera.<br><br>I enter a suco bar, one of the countless juice stalls brightening Rio&#x2019;s crumbling street corners, wondering if I can recognize any of the fruits. The purple a�ai berries on the menu look like the marbles we called &#x201c;nightmares&#x201d; in grade two. Across the counter sits a crate full of eyeballs. The owner hands me one of the red-rimmed ocular globules, and out dangles an optic nerve attached to a pitch-black iris and a leering white sclera. It&#x2019;s a guaran� fruit, he says, a natural stimulant that&#x2019;s processed to make energy-boosting shakes and soft drinks. I stare at it staring back at me.<br><br>Hypnotized, I copy the list of fruits on the stand&#x2019;s menu into my notebook.<br><br>By now, the sun is setting into the pastel horizon. Clouds of confetti swirl through the air, paving the ground with tropical snow. I nearly forgot that it&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Eve. The beach has filled with revelers dressed in white. Many have come to the ocean from hillside slums, bearing statues of Macumba saints. They light candles and arrange bits of ribbon around sacrificial flower petals for Iemanj�, the shape-shifting spirit of the waters. As their prayers crash against the waves, the surface of the sea dances with offerings.<br><br>I look down at my list of fruits and recite the names under my breath, syncing into the rhythms of nearby batucada drummers. Softly chanting, I close my eyes, and feel a sense of peace. For a moment, I forget everything. I forget my name. I forget why I came here. All I know is abacax�, a�ai, ameixa, cupua�u, graviola, maracuj�, tapereb�, uva, umbu.<br>Introduction<br>The Fruit Underworld<br><br>Man, you know Adam enjoyed things that kings and queens will never have and things kings and queens �can&#x2019;t never get and they �don&#x2019;t even know about.<br><br>&#x2013;Howlin&#x2019; Wolf, Going Down Slow<br><br>There is a theory that explains humankind&#x2019;s communion with fruits: biophilia, or the &#x201c;love of life.&#x201d; Psychologist Erich Fromm coined the term in 1964 as a way of describing the innate attraction to processes of life and growth. The hypothesis suggests that organisms facing death can preserve themselves through contact with living systems. Biologists then adopted the term, noting a tendency for humans to feel a spiritually transformative connectedness with nature. &#x201c;Our existence depends on this propensity,&#x201d; wrote Harvard entomologist Edward O. Wilson. Citing evidence of quicker rates of recovery for patients exposed to images of green spaces, scientists speculate that biophilia is an evolutionary mechanism ensuring the survival of interdependent life-forms.<br><br>In Brazil, fruits seemed to be calling out to me. I returned the call. From then on, I �couldn&#x2019;t seem to shake them. <br><br>As mundane as they may appear, fruits are also deeply alluring. To begin with, there&#x2019;s something unusual about their very omnipresence. Fruits are everywhere, perspiring on street corners, chilling in hotel lobbies and on teachers&#x2019; desks, coagulating in yogurts and drinks, adorning laptops and museum walls.<br><br>Although a select few species dominate international trade, our whole planet is brimming with fruits that are inaccessible, ignored and even forbidden. There are mangoes that taste like pi�a coladas. Orange cloudberries. White blueberries. Blue apricots. Red lemons. Golden raspberries. Pink cherimoyas. Willy Wonka&#x2019;s got nothing on Mother Nature.<br><br>The diversity is dizzying: most of us have never heard of the ara�a, but Amazonian fruit authorities say there are almost as many types of this �yellow-green guava relative as there are beaches in Brazil. Within the tens of thousands of edible plant species, there are hundreds of thousands of varieties&#x2013;and new ones are continually evolving. Magic beans, sundrops, cannonballs, delicious monsters, zombi apples, gingerbread plums, swan egg pears, Oaxacan trees of little skulls, Congo goobers, slow-match fruits, candle fruits, bastard cherries, bignays, belimbings, bilimbis and biribas. As Hamlet might&#x2019;ve said: &#x201c;There are more fruits in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&#x201d;<br><br>Among the fruit world&#x2019;s most euphonious offerings, the clove lilly pilly tastes like pumpkin pie and goes well with kangaroo meat. Existentialists might prefer camu-camus, which are purple drops of sour deliciousness. The yum-yum tree sprouts what appear to be fluffy yellow dusters. Certain Pacific islands have yang-yang trees up the yin yang. Other fruity two-twos include far-fars, lab-labs, num-nums, jum-lums and lovi-lovis.<br><br>Many botanically documented plants, like the looking-glass tree, appear to have somehow escaped from a Lewis Carroll laudanum reverie. The pincushion fruit, with its spiked cloak of white rays, is like an exploding star frozen in time. The toothbrush tree&#x2019;s fruits are eaten before bed in the Punjab and the fruits of the toothache tree are used in Virginia to alleviate dental malaise. Succulent umbrella fruits are cherished in the Congo. The glistening puddinglike eta fruit is eaten by tilting the head back and slurping it down like an oyster. The fruits of the toad tree look like frogs and taste like carrots. The milk orange of Wen-chou is a citrus fruit shot though with a creamy mist that, when peeled, swirls enchantingly through the air. Kids play football with the fruit of the money tree. The emu apple is eaten after being buried in soil for several days. Sword fruits call to mind dangling sabers in the moonlight; �they&#x2019;re also called broken bones plants or midnight horrors because clumps of fallen fruit are periodically mistaken for skeletal remains.<br><br>The pirate books young children devour occasionally mention the inconceivably delicious fruits that buccaneers used to eat while hiding out on tropical islands. In Neverland, the Lost Boys and Peter Pan, &#x201c;clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees,&#x201d; ate roasted breadfruits, mammee apples and calabashes of poe-poe. It was only in Brazil that I realized such fruits were real. There are thousands upon thousands of fruits that we never imagined&#x2013;and that few of us will ever taste, unless we embark on fruit-hunting expeditions.<br><br>In the tropics, kids eat rare jungle fruits the way North Americans eat candy. Even fruits that �we&#x2019;ve learned to steer clear of at supermarkets suddenly taste excellent in their native lands. When I first encountered a papaya on a teenaged trip to Central America, I was astounded by its flavor, how it filled my mouth with an edible perfume. The ones at home all tasted vaguely unhygienic.<br><br>In my experience, fruits are inextricably linked with travel, with other lands, with escaping. Growing up in suburban Montreal, winters were pretty fruitless. When I was thirteen, my family moved to Budapest for a couple of years. My brothers and I had never tasted apricots, peaches and tomatoes as good as the ones that grew in our backyard and in our relatives&#x2019; orchards. It was easy to see why the Hungarian word for &#x201c;paradise&#x201d; also means tomato: paradiscom.<br><br>Ten years later, I tasted a grape at my father&#x2019;s Hungarian vineyard that floored me with a recollection from age four or five. It was dawn, and my brother and I woke up to go buy grape Bubblicious at the Black Cat, a candy store down the street. The store was off-limits&#x2013;as was most candy&#x2013;but, overcome with desire for those cubes of purple awesomeness, we decided the solution was simply to go and get some before our parents woke up. We arrived at the Black Cat as the sun was rising. Needless to say, it �wasn&#x2019;t open. We peered through the window at the fireworks, comic books, arcade games, and all those candies. Clutching our fistfuls of nickels and dimes, we hiked back home to our anxious parents, who had called the police and started a manhunt. Like something out of Ingmar Bergman&#x2019;s Wild Strawberries, the buried escapade returned with an instant recall the moment I tasted that Concord grape.<br><br>Pablo Neruda said that when we bite into apples, we become, for an instant, young again. When I was in Paris, an Algerian taxi driver spent the entire ride describing the prickly pears of his youth, lamenting their taste in France but vividly recalling how sweet they were in his homeland. A wholesaler in New York told me of discovering a quince perfuming the clothes in his mother&#x2019;s armoire when he was a child. &#x201c;What did you do when you found it?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;I sniffed it,&#x201d; he replied.<br><br>Bertolt Brecht once wrote a poem about seeing some fruits in the tree outside his window that teleported him to a more innocent age. In the verses he spends a few minutes debating quite seriously whether to put on his glasses &#x201c;in order to see those black berries again on their tiny red stalks.&#x201d; The poem ends without any resolution. Brecht left it ambiguous, but I cannot. I pick up my glasses and am sucked into a Proustian fruit wormhole, where I find myself in the company of other shortsighted pomophiles.<br><br>Largely hidden from the public eye, there exists a subculture of enthusiasts who have devoted their lives to the quest for fruit. With associations like the North American Fruit Explorers and the Rare Fruit Council International, the denizens of this fruit underworld are as special as the flora they pursue. The forest, from the Latin floris, meaning &#x201c;outside,&#x201d; has always attracted outsiders. Since 1910, the word &#x201c;fruit&#x201d; has been used to denote an eccentric or unusual person. Writing this story meant getting to know fruit nuts, fruit smugglers, fruit explorers, fruit fetishists, fruit inventors, fruit cops, fruit robbers, fruitarians and even a fruit massager. These characters offer a glimpse into our planet&#x2019;s diversity&#x2013;both botanical and human.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Y No Se Lo Trago LA Tierra and the Earth Did Not Devour Him (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Examines the lives of migrant workers moving from south Texas up through the Plains, and the experiences of all ages and sexes</p><p>Text: English, Spanish</p><h2>Uncle Dynamite (Collector&#39;s Wodehouse)</h2><p>Wodehouse fans beware: Uncle Fred is in town and that means another literary dose of wacky hi-jinks. Love is in the air in Uncle Dynamite, and good old Fred (a.k.a. Lord Ickenham) resorts to impersonations, blackmail and ridiculous irreverence in an effort to sort out the havoc of a matchmaking blunderbuss.</p><p><b>P. G. Wodehouse</b> (1881-1975) grew up in England and came to the United States just before World War I, when he married an American. He wrote more than ninety books, and his works, translated into many languages, won him worldwide acclaim.We might save everyone trouble by not bothering to review Wodehouse audiobooks. Instead, we could simply announce, "Here's a new one. Come and get it!" However, as excellent as the recordings usually are, not every Wodehouse text is wonderful, so we must carry on. Happily, Uncle Dynamite is another winner. First published in 1948, it is one of the few books about Uncle Fred (a.k.a. Lord Ickenham) and the usual complicated Wodehouse story line: A loves B but is engaged to C, whom D secretly loves, and so on. Of course, with Uncle Fred spreading sweetness and light, generous helpings of happy endings can be counted on.

The elegant country house is first glimpsed from a nearby hill in Tudor times; the scenes that follow suggest changes in the garden, park, and exterior (rebuilt after a fire in the early Stuart period; the Regency produced a new Gothic fa&#x2021;ade and conservatory) as well as activities (upstairs and down) and furnishings within. As always, Goodall's watercolors are richly evocative, their many details carefully researched. A bored child, member of a modern tour group, appears in the last picture; she might have been more interested if she'd seen this book before her visit. For imaginative readers, Anglophiles, and travelers. (Nonfiction/Picture book. 5+) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Large format, double-page spreads provide a slice-of-life look at changes surrounding this house in dress, decor, work, and social activities. One to several double-page spreads are devoted to each era, from the Tudor period to the present day. Framed along the bottom of each page are, on the left side, the name and dates of a time period and, on the right, a short phrase describing the scene above. Goodall draws readers into the book with numerous tidbits of information about the lifestyles.

Christopher draws inspiration for the world of Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, from the natural beauty that surrounds his home in Montana: the tumultuous weather, the rushing Yellowstone River, and the soaring Beartooth Mountains. <br><br>Read on for Paolini and Tad Williams's discussion about why they write fantasy, their upcoming projects, and more. <br> <br> <strong>Tad:</strong> Hi, Christopher. Nice to talk to you, albeit virtually. It was great hanging out with you and your family this summer. Pretty much all of us fell in love with your part of the world, too. <br><br> Be warned: this isn't my best time of the day, so if I start calling you "Herman" and asking what it was about whaling that interested you, please forgive. <br><br> The first thing I'd like to ask you as a starter question is: why fantasy? I mean, there's the obvious answer (which is also true for me) that it was something I loved to read growing up, but I guess I'm curious what is it that still resonates for you. Why do these kind of stories, these kinds of characters, these kinds of worlds, still speak to you? <br> In a similar vein, do you have another kind of fiction, another genre, that you'd really like to try? If so, why? Any genres you think you'll never write but wish you could? <br> <br> <strong>Christopher:</strong> Hi Tad. Great talking to you as well. We all had a wonderful time when you guys visited. Definitely one of the highlights of the year. <br> <br> I'm still waking up as well -- takes a few cups of tea and a few strips of bacon before the little gray cells start firing properly -- so if I sound a bit muddled, that's why. Still, we can make a stab at coherency, eh? <br><br> Hmm. Why do I write fantasy? As you said, it's because I enjoy reading it, but I enjoy reading it because . . . well, for a number of reasons, I suppose. First of all, fantasy allows for all sorts of dangerous situations, and those can provide a lot of excitement in a story. And excitement is always fun. Also, epic fantasy usually deals with themes and situations that everyone can relate to, such as the challenge of growing up, or how one is supposed to deal with moral quandaries. Fantasy is the oldest form of literature; the very first stories that humans told while crouched around campfires were stories about gods and monsters and tragic mistakes and heroic feats. Even now, those topics still resonate with us on a primal level, which is one reason I think fantasy will remain popular with readers as long as humans are still human. And I love the sense of awe and wonder one can often find in fantastical literature. . . . Fantasy can allow you to see and hear and experience things that have never existed and never *could* exist. To me, that is the closest we come to real magic in this world. <br><br>&nbsp; That said, there are a number of other genres I'd like to try my hand at: mystery, thriller, horror, science-fiction, romance, etc. I love stories of all kinds -- although mythic ones certainly hold the greatest appeal to me -- and I'm very much looking forward to experimenting once I finish the Inheritance cycle. Any genres I think I'll never write but wish I could? . . . Probably long-form epic poetry or a witty comedy of manners. Poetry is fun, but my grasp on it is rather shaky, and a comedy of manners (while I enjoy them) is so different from my usual life, I'm not sure I could pull it off properly. <br> <br> And now a question for you: You have just finished your third (large) series. What is it about big epic stories that so fascinates you? Why not write small, intimate books about a fishmonger whose greatest love is his toothpick sculpture of the Brooklyn Bridge? <br> <br> <strong> Read the full conversation </strong><b>Tad Williams</b> has held more jobs than any sane person should admit to&#x2014;singing in a band, selling shoes, managing a financial institution, throwing newspapers, and designing military manuals, to name just a few.

Much of Hawthorne&#39;s writing centers on New England, many works featuring moral allegories with a Puritan inspiration. His fiction works are considered part of the Romantic movement and more specifically, Dark romanticism. His themes often center on the inherent evil and sin of humanity and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. His published works include novels, short stories and a biography of his college friend Franklin Pierce.Tanglewood Tales For Girls and Boys<br><i>The Wayside</i>INTRODUCTORYA short time ago, I was favored with a flying visit from my young friend Eustace Bright, whom I had not before met with since quitting the breezy mountains of Berkshire. It being the winter vacation at his college, Eustace was allowing himself a little relaxation, in the hope, he told me, of repairing the inroads which severe application to study had made upon his health; and I was happy to conclude, from the excellent physical condition in which I saw him, that the remedy had already been attended with very desirable success. He had now run up from Boston by the noon train, partly impelled by the friendly regard with which he is pleased to honor me, and partly, as I soon found, on a matter of literary business.It delighted me to receive Mr. Bright, for the first time, under a roof, though a very humble one, which I could really call my own. Nor did I fail (as is the custom of landed proprietors all about the world) to parade the poor fellow up and down over my half a dozen acres; secretly rejoicing, nevertheless, that the disarray of the inclement season, and particularly the six inches of snow then upon theground, prevented him from observing the ragged neglect of soil and shrubbery into which the place has lapsed. It was idle, however, to imagine that an airy guest from Monument Mountain, Bald-Summit, and old Graylock, shaggy with primeval forests, could see anything to admire in my poor little hill-side, with its growth of frail and insect-eaten locust-trees. Eustace very frankly called the view from my hill-top tame; and so, no doubt, it was, after rough, broken, rugged, headlong Berkshire, and especially the northern parts of the county, with which his college residence had made him familiar. But to me there is a peculiar, quiet charm in these broad meadows and gentle eminences. They are better than mountains, because they do not stamp and stereotype themselves into the brain, and thus grow wearisome with the same strong impression, repeated day after day. A few summer weeks among mountains, a lifetime among green meadows and placid slopes, with outlines forever new, because continually fading out of the memory,--such would be my sober choice.I doubt whether Eustace did not internally pronounce the whole thing a bore, until I led him to my predecessor's little ruined, rustic summer-house, midway on the hill-side. It is a mere skeleton of slender, decaying tree-trunks, with neither walls nor a roof; nothing but a tracery of branches and twigs, which the next wintry blast will be very likely to scatter in fragments along the terrace. It looks, and is, as evanescent as a dream; and yet, in its rustic net-work of boughs, it has somehow enclosed a hint of spiritual beauty, and has become a true emblem of the subtile and ethereal mind that planned it. I made Eustace Bright sit down on a snow-bank, which had heaped itself over the mossy seat, and gazing through the arched window opposite, he acknowledged that the scene at once grew picturesque."Simple as it looks," said he, "this little edifice seems to be the work of magic. It is full of suggestiveness, and, in its way, is as good as a cathedral. Ah, it would be just the spot for one to sit in, of a summer afternoon, and tell the children some more of those wild stories from the classic myths!""It would, indeed," answered I. "The summer-house itself, so airy and so broken, is like one of those old tales, imperfectly remembered; and these living branches of the Baldwin apple-tree, thrusting themselves so rudely in, are like your unwarrantable interpolations. But, by the by, have you added any more legends to the series, since the publication of the Wonder Book?""Many more," said Eustace; "Primrose, Periwinkle, and the rest of them allow me no comfort of my life, unless I tell them a story every day or two. I have run away from home partly to escape the importunity of those little wretches! But I have written out six of the new stories, and have brought them for you to look over.""Are they as good as the first?" I inquired."Better chosen, and better handled," replied Eustace Bright. "You will say so when you read them.""Possibly not," I remarked. "I know, from my own experience, that an author's last work is always his best one, in his own estimate, until it quite loses the red heat of composition. After that, it falls into its true place, quietly enough. But let us adjourn to my study, and examine these new stories. It would hardly be doing yourself justice, were you to bring me acquainted with them, sitting here on this snowbank!"So we descended the hill to my small, old cottage, and shut ourselves up in the southeastern room, where the sunshine comes in, warmly and brightly, through the better half of a winter's day. Eustace put his bundle of manuscript into my hands; and I skimmed through it pretty rapidly, trying to find out its merits and demerits by the touch of my fingers, as a veteran story-teller ought to know how to do.It will be remembered, that Mr. Bright condescended to avail himself of my literary experience by constituting me editor of the Wonder Book. As he had no reason to complain of the reception of that erudite work by the public, he was now disposed to retain me in a similar position, with respect to the present volume, which he entitled "TANGLEWOOD TALES." Not, as Eustace hinted, that therewas any real necessity for my services as introductor, inasmuch as his own name had become established, in some good degree of favor, with the literary world. But the connection with myself, he was kind enough to say, had been highly agreeable; nor was he by any means desirous, as most people are, of kicking away the ladder that had perhaps helped him to reach his present elevation. My young friend was willing, in short, that the fresh verdure of his growing reputation should spread over my straggling and half-naked boughs; even as I have sometimes thought of training a vine, with its broad leafiness, and purple fruitage, over the worm-eaten posts and rafters of the rustic summer-house. I was not insensible to the advantages of his proposal, and gladly assured him of my acceptance.Merely from the titles of the stories, I saw at once that the subjects were not less rich than those of the former volume; nor did I at all doubt that Mr. Bright's audacity (so far as that endowment might avail) had enabled him to take full advantage of whatever capabilities they offered. Yet, in spite of my experience of his free way of handling them, I did not quite see, I confess, how he could have obviated all the difficulties in the way of rendering them presentable to children. These old legends, so brimming over with everything that is most abhorrent to our Christianized moral sense,--some of them so hideous, others so melancholy and miserable, amid which the Greek tragedians sought their themes, and moulded them into the sternest forms of grief that ever the world saw; was such material the stuff that children's playthings should be made of! How were they to be purified? How was the blessed sunshine to be thrown into them?But Eustace told me that these myths were the most singular things in the world, and that he was invariably astonished, whenever he began to relate one, by the readiness with which it adapted itself to the childish purity of his auditors. The objectionable characteristics seem to be a parasitical growth, having no essential connection with the original fable. They fall away, and are thought of no more, the instant he puts his imagination in sympathy with theinnocent little circle, whose wide-open eyes are fixed so eagerly upon him. Thus the stories (not by any strained effort of the narrator's, but in harmony with their inherent germ) transform themselves, and reassume the shapes which they might be supposed to possess in the pure childhood of the world. When the first poet or romancer told these marvellous legends (such is Eustace Bright's opinion), it was still the Golden Age. Evil had never yet existed; and sorrow, misfortune, crime, were mere shadows which the mind fancifully created for itself, as a shelter against too sunny realities; or, at most, but prophetic dreams, to which the dreamer himself did not yield a waking credence. Children are now the only representatives of the men and women of that happy era; and therefore it is that we must raise the intellect and fancy to the level of childhood, in order to re-create the original myths.I let the youthful author talk as much and as extravagantly as he pleased, and was glad to see him commencing life with such confidence in himself and his performances. A few years will do all that is necessary towards showing him the truth in both respects. Meanwhile, it is but right to say, he does really appear to have overcome the moral objections against these fables, although at the expense of such liberties with their structure as must be left to plead their own excuse, without any help from me. Indeed, except that there was a necessity for it,--and that the inner life of the legends cannot be come at save by making them entirely one's own property,--there is no defence to be made.Eustace informed me that he had told his stories to the children in various situations,--in the woods, on the shore of the lake, in the dell of Shadow Brook, in the play-room, at Tanglewood fireside, and in a magnificent palace of snow, with ice windows, which he helped his little friends to build. His auditors were even more delighted with the contents of the present volume than with the specimens which have already been given to the world. The classically learned Mr. Pringle, too, had listened to two or three of the tales, and censured them even more bitterly than hedid THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES: so that, what with praise, and what with criticism, Eustace Bright thinks that there is good hope of at least as much success with the public as in the case of the Wonder Book.I made all sorts of inquiries about the children, not doubting that there would be great eagerness to hear of their welfare among some good little folks who have written to me, to ask for another volume of myths. They are all, I am happy to say (unless we except Clover), in excellent health and spirits. Primrose is now almost a young lady, and, Eustace tells me, is just as saucy as ever. She pretends to consider herself quite beyond the age to be interested by such idle stories as these; but, for all that, whenever a story is to be told, Primrose never fails to be one of the listeners, and to make fun of it when finished. Periwinkle is very much grown, and is expected to shut up her baby-house and throw away her doll in a month or two more. Sweet Fern has learned to read and write, and has put on a jacket and pair of pantaloons,--all of which improvements I am sorry for. Squash-Blossom, Blue Eye, Plantain, and Buttercup have had the scarlet fever, but came easily through it. Huckleberry, Milkweed, and Dandelion were attacked with the whooping-cough, but bore it bravely, and kept out of doors whenever the sun shone. Cowslip, during the autumn, had either the measles, or some eruption that looked very much like it, but was hardly sick a day. Poor Clover has been a good deal troubled with her second teeth, which have made her meagre in aspect and rather fractious in temper; nor, even when she smiles, is the matter much mended, since it discloses a gap just within her lips, almost as wide as the barn door. But all this will pass over, and it is predicted that she will turn out a very pretty girl.As for Mr. Bright himself, he is now in his senior year at Williams College, and has a prospect of graduating with some degree of honorable distinction at the next Commencement. In his oration for the bachelor's degree, he gives me to understand, he will treat of the classical myths, viewed in the aspect of baby stories, and has agreat mind to discuss the expediency of using up the whole of ancient history for the same purpose. I do not know what he means to do with himself after leaving college, but trust that, by dabbling so early with the dangerous and seductive business of authorship, he will not be tempted to become an author by profession. If so, I shall be very sorry for the little that I have had to do with the matter, in encouraging these first beginnings.I wish there were any likelihood of my soon seeing Primrose, Periwinkle, Dandelion, Sweet Fern, Clover, Plantain, Huckleberry, Milkweed, Cowslip, Buttercup, Blue Eye, and Squash-Blossom again. But as I do not know when I shall revisit Tanglewood, and as Eustace Bright probably will not ask me to edit a third Wonder Book, the public of little folks must not expect to hear any more about those dear children from me. Heaven bless them, and everybody else, whether grown people or children!THE WAYSIDE, CONCORD, MASS,<i>March</i> 13, 1853.All new material copyright � 1999 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC</p><h2>Divine Conquest</h2><p>Tozer&#39;s profound &#39;prequel&#39; to The Pursuit of God.</p><p>A.

After a chance meeting with a McKenzie River dory builder, Fulmar constructed his first dory and rowed the San Juan in 1947. Traveling through Grand Canyon in 1948 on a Norm Nevills expedition, Fulmar met Colorado River historian Dock Marston and they went on to run rivers together and correspond for the next thirty years. Fulmar built his second dory, the Gem, specifically for big water. Joining forces with Pat Reilly in 1954, they ran the Grand Canyon five times in home-built boats. Their adventures included rowing the wild Colorado River in 1957 on 125,000 cubic feet per second, one of the highest flows in the last century. Using historic photos, river logs, letters and interviews, author Tom Martin recounts the voyages of a number of unsung river runners during the transformation from Grand Canyon expeditionary river running into today&#39;s whitewater recreation.

This dictionary may not make it possible to communicate with today's "gangstas" (a term that does not appear in the book) or "rappers" (which does), but it will assist those who encounter such terms in black authors or on TV. Major is a novelist and poet and the author of <i>The Dictionary of African-American Slang</i> (1970), on which this book is based.<p>A brief explanatory note describes the entries, the cultures from which they arose, and geographic areas of use, which are coded in the entries. Major lists his sources and uses a simple code in entries to refer back to the source. Thus, the source for <i>cogs</i>, a 1930s Harlem term for sunglasses, can be traced to two books by Cab Calloway. Sources range from Flexner's <i>I Hear American Talking</i> to Zora Neale Hurston's novels, newspaper articles, and the novels of Donald Goines. All entries note the decade in which the word was first used, and most have an example sentence.</p><p>Major's claim for the exclusivity of some of his terms is weak. <i>Duking</i> as a term for fist-fighting is not uniquely black. (See Jonathon Green, <i>The Dictionary of Contemporary Slang</i>, p.83.) <i>Gaspers</i> as a synonym for cigarettes appears frequently in P. G. Wodehouse and is cited in <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> as far back as 1914.</p><p>This book reflects the varied worlds of black slang from the witty 1940s phrase "straight up six o'clock girl" for a very thin woman to the grim euphemism "dime bag" for $10 worth of marijuana or morphine. There is plenty of prison, drug, and crime slang, with words and phrases to offend every sensibility. This dictionary will be a useful addition to any public or academic library and a necessary purchase for any special collection on African Americans or slang and unconventional English. <i></i></p></p><h2>Urban Alchemy: Restoring Joy in America&#39;s Sorted-Out Cities</h2><p><strong>An identification of the problems of divided neighborhoods and nine tools that can mend them</strong>&nbsp;What if divided neighborhoods were causing public health problems?

Suddenly the tranquility of the scene is shattered by an explosion that kills the Cahills' arrogant, selfish neighbor Sir Lucas Dearden, a retired criminal lawyer, and shatters his Mercedes. Sir Lucas had enemies, among them, perhaps, his gentle spy-novelist son Nicholas, who ia married to the high-strung Gwen. But Dorothea is quite sure the booby trap was meant for her bachelor son Jonathan, the motive being Jonathan's passion for Gwen. (Jonathan would normally have been coming home from work at about the time of Sir Lucas's unexpected return from London.) Many red herrings and blind alleys later, unwilling amateur sleuth Andrew (who dislikes Christmas but loves Dorothea's cucumber sandwiches) comes to a surprising and satisfying conclusion, helped by the discovery that one page is missing from the typescript of Lucas's dismayingly dull memoirs.

The first is money, and I can't remember what the second one is.&#x201d; To an extent that would have made Hanna blush, a series of developments capped by the Supreme Court's 2010 <i>Citizens United</i> decision effectively crowned a bunch of billionaires and their operatives the new kings of politics.<br><br><i>Big Money</i> is a rollicking tour of a new political world dramatically reordered by ever-larger flows of cash. Ken Vogel has breezed into secret gatherings of big-spending Republicans and Democrats alike from California poolsides to DC hotel bars to brilliantly expose the way the mega-money men (and rather fewer women) are dominating the new political landscape.<br><br>Great wealth seems to attach itself to outsize characters. From the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to the bubbling nouveau cowboy Foster Friess; from the Texas trial lawyer couple, Amber and Steve Mostyn, to the micromanaging Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg the multimillionaires and billionaires are swaggering up to the tables for the hottest new game in politics. The prize is American democracy, and the players' checks keep getting bigger.</p><p><b>Ken Vogel</b> covers the confluence of money, politics, and influence for <i>Politico</i>.

He analyzes politics on national television and radio, and lives in Alexandria, Virginia, with his wife, Danielle, and their dog, Ali. Follow him on Twitter @kenvogel.<b>Bethany McLean, <i>Washington Post</i></b><br> [Vogel] knows the characters and gets the game. Want to understand Mitt Romney's fundraising operation, how Jim Messina mobilized big donors for Obama's 2012 campaign or the war chest that is already growing underneath Hillary Clinton? Vogel tells the stories. He also offers lots of detail on one of the most fascinating frenmities in modern right-wing politics: Karl Rove and the Koch brothers. And he offers great facts to bolster his overall claim...To his great credit, Vogel is also pretty even-handed...This is a book by an insider, for insiders.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Daniel Ben-Ami, <i>Financial Times</i></b><br> Kenneth Vogel, chief investigative reporter for Politico, the news organisation, does an excellent job in untangling this story. Much of the book consists of reportage, with him trying to attend secretive meetings between ultra-wealthy donors and electoral candidates seeking funding. Often he was barred from entering or ejected after being identified as a journalist .He is commendably non-partisan in his reporting. Vogel sketches the shadowy fundraising worlds of both of the main parties. He also reports on the intense factional rivalry that sometimes exists within their respective camps.&#x201d;<br><br><b>James Kwak, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> What Vogel gives us is a detailed look at this new political landscape, where voracious money-sucking beasts mingle with megadonors hungry for behind-the-scenes access Whether we are witnessing is a tectonic shift or a gradual evolution, Big Money' amply and colorfully makes the case that our elected leaders are increasingly dependent on a small number of seven-digit checks written by a few dozen members of the 0.01 percent, and therefore politics are becoming a type of thoroughbred horse racing.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Barton Swaim, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> With Big Money' -which takes up the Kochs and other rich political contributors, including Sheldon Adelson, Rob McKay and liberal Texas lawyers Steve and Amber Mostyn -Mr. Vogel has succeeded in doing what I, for one, didn't think possible. He has made the subject of money in politics entertaining indeed, gripping. He does this by a combination of factual analysis, eyebrow-raising scoops and zany stories.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Michael Levin, <i>Huffington Post</i></b><br> Vogel is a master of Politico's deliciously snarky political style and offers us glimpses of our elders and betters at their least dignified. Vogel's <i>Big Money</i> is a must-read if you are concerned about politics and the future of this country.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Walter Shapiro, Brennan Center for Justice</b><br> Vogel's paparazzi tactics -- coupled with relentless traditional reporting -- have made <i>Big Money</i> the smartest and most revealing book chronicling the Super PAC era. Instead of predictable legal analysis and a mind-numbing march of statistics, Vogel tries to grasp what motivates the wealthy to invest so heavily in Super PACs. And his answers do not fit into the neat ideological cubbyholes of either campaign reformers or believers in the nonsensical, but powerful, doctrine that money equals free speech.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Chris Moody, Yahoo!

This is the dark, at times brutal, story of the kidnapping of Mississippi debutante Temple Drake, who introduces her own form of venality into the Memphis underworld where she is being held. Faulkner was an American writer and Nobel Prize laureate from Oxford, Mississippi. He wrote novels, short stories, poetry, essays, and screenplays. He is primarily known for his novels and short stories set in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, based on Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life. Faulkner is one of the most celebrated writers in American literature generally and Southern literature specifically. Though his work was published as early as 1919, and largely during the 1920s and 1930s, He was relatively unknown until receiving the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature, for which he became the only Mississippi-born Nobel winner. Two of his works, A Fable (1954) and his last novel The Reivers (1962), won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked his 1929 novel The Sound and the Fury sixth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.</p><p>This product is not a traditionally bound book.

The author argues persuasively that the Italian humanists drew their inspiration more from the church fathers than from the pagan ancients . . . the most comprehensive and most important study of Italian humanism to appear in English. It is a mine of information, offering, among other things, detailed analyses of texts which have been ignored even by Italian scholars.</p><p>Charles Trinkaus (1911&#x2013;1999) was emeritus professor of history at the University of Michigan.

To many, he is the finest Italian poet after Dante. (Jonathan Galassi's translation of Leopardi's <i>Canti</i> was published by FSG in 2010.)<br> He was also a prodigious scholar of classical literature and philosophy, and a voracious reader in numerous ancient and modern languages. For most of his writing career, he kept an immense notebook, known as the <i>Zibaldone</i>, or "hodge-podge," as Harold Bloom has called it, in which Leopardi put down his original, wide-ranging, radically modern responses to his reading. His comments about religion, philosophy, language, history, anthropology, astronomy, literature, poetry, and love are unprecedented in their brilliance and suggestiveness, and the <i>Zibaldone</i>, which was only published at the turn of the twentieth century, has been recognized as one of the foundational books of modern culture. Its 4,500-plus pages have never been fully translated into English until now, when a team under the auspices of Michael Caesar and Franco D'Intino of the Leopardi Centre in Birmingham, England, have spent years producing a lively, accurate version.

Something is rotten in both the states of New York and Texas, and Kinky takes it upon himself to locate not one, but two of God&#39;s creatures who have gone astray. Dylan Weinberg is an eleven-year-old boy with a rare form of autism -- a pint-sized stock-market wizard who can only utter one word, &#34;Shnay.&#34; He&#39;s on a multitude of medications, and one night his father wakes up to find Dylan perched over his bed like some preteen zombie, clutching a pair of scissors and cutting up the sheets. Since that evening, two weeks ago, Dylan has been missing, and the cops have no leads -- and apparently not much interest. That&#39;s why, in an absolute last-resort maneuver, the family has called in Kinky to the rescue. And speaking of rescue, Kinky&#39;s second missing person -- make that missing pussy -- case comes courtesy of his Cousin Nancy (no relationship), who, along with Kinky, helped found the Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch in Utopia, Texas. Lucky, the three-legged cat -- and unofficial mascot of the ranch -- is gone, the victim of an apparent kittynapping. Cousin Nancy is convinced the feline is either in the hands of some nasty, contentious neighbors or is being sacrificed by a satanic cult. No matter what, she wants Kinky to find Lucky before he becomes coyote chow. It&#39;s an uneven dilemma for Kinky -- stay in town and concentrate on finding a sick, missing child (and concentrate, too, on Julia, said child&#39;s beautiful, long-legged sister), or hotfoot off to Texas, to help calm down the frantic Cousin Nancy who&#39;s this close to proclaiming Lucky&#39;s been abducted by aliens. Kinky puts his trust in his faithful companion, Village Irregular Steve Rambam, to help find the little boy while Kinky hightails it to Utopia, Texas, where Nancy provides him with two witnesses to the alleged crime -- a dim-sighted eighty-year-old lady named Josephine and a frisky canine named Mr. Magoo. Back in New York, Rambam has no clue where Dylan might be, but he is becoming increasingly sure that Julia is the Jewish answer to his romantic prayers. Kinky warns him to put the wedding plans on hold and track down Hattie Mamajello, Dylan&#39;s former nanny, but it&#39;s too little too late when Hattie is pushed off a subway platform and killed. The confusion generated by these two disparate cases is enough to drive a dick to drink -- which Kinky is happy to do -- but he&#39;s still got a missing kid and a missing kitty on his cigar-stained hands to locate before (a) Rambam whisks Julia off to Vegas for a quickie wedding and (b) Cousin Nancy calls in the FBI, the CIA, and the Mossad to find her Lucky. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, aided and abetted by a few four-legged friends, the mystery of the purloined kitty continues to grow. Then it&#39;s back to the wilds of midtown Manhattan and the even wilder wilds of Sche-nectady, New York, where, in their search for the missing boy, Kinky and his two-legged cohort find themselves at an orphanage Dickens would be proud of. True to Kinky&#39;s form, and informed with truth, Meanwhile Back at the Ranch is a wild and woolly (and furry) ride from a true original, and entertainment at its most outrageous.</p><p><b>Kinky Friedman</b> lives in a little green trailer somewhere in the hills of Texas. He has four dogs, one cat, one armadillo, and one Smith Corona typewriter. According to Mr. Friedman, he is the only free man on this train.<p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Like a jaded, Jewish juggler in the cheap sideshow of life, one cold, gray afternoon I suddenly found myself with five balls in the air. Unfortunately, two of them were my own. Ah, but the other three! That's where the story really began. For the first time since God gave Gatorade to the Israelites, I had three potentially big cases all going for me at once. Many aspects of this investigative trinity were so daunting that I'd taken to referring to each case with a code name. Rambam, my half-Jewish, half-law-abiding P.I. pal, had provided the three investigations with their cryptic monikers. I was not wild about the three names he'd chosen, but at least they provided a handy way to converse clandestinely about these matters, thereby keeping the other Village Irregulars in total innocence. </p><p> "I'm just not sure," I said to the cat, "that Moe, Larry, and Curly are quite the correct nomenclature for matters of this import." </p><p> The cat, of course, said nothing. She contented herself with sitting precisely in the middle of the desk and looking at me with pity in her eyes. This did not surprise me. Cats, like many people, have almost no sense of humor. The last thing on the planet liable to entertain a cat would be the Three Stooges. </p><p> All I knew about the cases at this point was as follows: As regards to Moe, I was four steps behind a possible serial killer. As far as Larry went, I was tantalizingly close to locating a missing autistic child who only said the word "shnay." As far as Curly was concerned, I can say nothing at all except that the investigation was so big it made the Giant Rat of Sumatra look like Mickey Mouse. </p><p> For a few furious hours, I manned the phones, talking tersely to Rambam, New York Police Detective Sergeant Mort Cooperman, Detective Sergeant Buddy Fox, and various other concerned parties whose identities I feel morally obligated to protect at this time. I maintain two red telephones on my desk, both attached to the same line and both placed precisely equidistant from the cat. If I'd had a million red telephones, I felt, I'd still not be on top of things. Finally, I took a break. I lit my third Cuban cigar of the day and walked over to the window to watch the garbage trucks. It's a little funny and a little sad to see the things people throw away in their lives. Some of them won't even fit into a garbage truck. </p><p> The only sound within the loft emanated from my commercial-sized espresso machine, which appeared to be dangerously close to liftoff. The hissing, steaming, gurgling tones sounded very much like "Blowin' in the Wind" being performed by a drowning kazoo player. I myself, worn to a frazzle from attempting to conduct three investigations at once, felt like a man dying of syphilis at the turn of the century. The cat, as one might expect, was invariably in a mood that ran counter to my own. She practically frolicked along the windowsill in unbridled, John Denver-like joy. </p><p> "It's almost good to be alive," I said, paraphrasing my father. </p><p> The cat did not respond. She did not believe in paraphrasing anybody. If a cat can't quote things precisely, the cat nearly always prefers to remain silent. If people pursued this same feline wisdom there'd be a lot fewer misunderstandings, a lot fewer wars, and a lot fewer people ripping off Oscar Wilde at cocktail parties. </p><p> I drew a hot, bitter espresso from the giant, gleaming dildo that took up about a third of my little kitchen and wandered back over to the window and stood with the cat, watching some more garbage trucks. There were worldfuls of garbage trucks and worldfuls of cats and worldfuls of people like me wondering where the hell everybody went. As far as a financial pleasure for the Kinkster went, my previous three cases might've just as well ridden out on one of the garbage trucks. I'd managed to cajole the Village Irregulars into infiltrating Winnie Katz's lesbian domain in the loft above and wound up wearing a red wig. I'd tackled a cell of international terrorists and was just happy to finally have the severed finger removed from the freezer compartment of my refrigerator. I'd also attempted to locate McGovern, who'd disappeared off the coast of Hawaii while researching recipes for his cookbook, <i>Eat, Drink, and Be Kinky.</i> He was eventually found with a little help from one of Stephanie DuPont's four-legged friends, an intrepid young Maltese named Baby Savannah. </p><p> Even though there'd been no payoff and the cases all had mixed results, I nonetheless took a small measure of pride in the seminal role I'd performed in my recent work. Had I not been successful, I thought, the world might've been overrun with lesbians and terrorists and McGovern might've been still wandering around lost in a fog somewhere. There are those, of course, who might point out that that's a fairly accurate description of how things are these days anyway. </p><p> My past triumphs and defeats, however, were all smoke now, I thought, as I glanced at my dusty reflection in the windowpane. The puppethead, which currently resided atop the mantel of the fireplace, had watched it all go down and now seemed to be smiling at me with a little wooden smile on its face. It was, I noticed, almost precisely the same little wooden smile I was currently wearing myself. Like father, like son. It pays to have a sense of humor in this life. If you don't, Allah knows what will happen. </p><p> I was puffing rather pridefully on my cigar, thinking of how challenging and potentially profitable my three new cases might be, when the phones rang. It could well be a call regarding Moe, Larry, or Curly which would, no doubt, send me into another fugue of feverish activity. I rapidly finished feeding the cat a can of Flaked Tuna with Egg Bits in Sauce, goose-stepped over to the desk, and picked up the blower on the left. </p><p> "Start talkin'," I said. </p><p> "Kinky!" said a highly excited, out-of-breath-sounding female voice. "It's Cousin Nancy from Utopia!" </p><p> I puffed stoically on the cigar, settling back in my chair for what could be a long winter. I blew a patient plume of blue smoke upward toward Winnie Katz's lesbian dance class. </p><p> "Come in, Berlin," I said. </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Kinky Friedman</p></p><h2>Motorcycle Diaries</h2><p>An expanded and freshly translated edition of the cult bestseller, for a new generation of Che Guevara fans.

However, his photographic work, consisting of several thousand images, has so far received little critical attention or sustained public exposure. This book reproduces many previously unseen photographs and offers fascinating insights into his photographic practices. It also provides convincing evidence that his photos should be considered a significant aspect of his entire body of work. It includes portraits and self-portraits, location shots from his travels in Europe, the Americas, and North Africa, images of construction and demolition sites, and his individual and collaborative experiments with photomontage, assemblage, and collage. Essays by internationally acclaimed scholars of photography and of Burroughs&#x2019;s work offer a variety of critical perspectives on his photographic oeuvre, examining its sources, methodologies, biographical contexts, influences, and purposes. Certain to appeal to his many devoted fans, this publication also coincides with a recent revival of critical and cultural interest in the 1960s art scene and the Beat Generation&#x2019;s writers and artists.</p><p>Patricia Allmer is a Chancellor&#39;s Fellow at the University of Edinburgh.

This is my Journey.</b></p><p>With these words, in the spring of 2010, Susan Marie Conrad scaled her world down to an 18-foot sea kayak and launched a solo journey that took her north to Alaska. With no sense of where she belonged in space and unreconciled feelings of a painful childhood following her, she decided that instead of running away, she would run toward her dreams. Her adventure took her along the western coast of North America, through the Inside Passage--a 1,200-mile ribbon of water--in a journey of the sea and soul.</p><p>The expedition took her deep within herself, humbling her, healing her, helping her to discover the depths of her own strength and courage. On her way from Anacortes, Washington, to Juneau, Alaska, she grappled with fear and exhaustion, forged friendships with quirky people in the strangest places, endured perilous weather and angry seas, and pretended not to be intimidated by 700-pound grizzly bears and 40-ton whales.</p><p>She lived her dream.</p></p><p><p>Susan Conrad grew up on a small farm in upstate New York, where she nurtured her sense of adventure amidst 500 acres of hayfields, stonewalls, and deciduous forests. By dint of exploring the mountains of Colorado, Oregon, and Montana, she eventually discovered the dynamic and addictive environment of coastal British Columbia and Washington State, where she still thrives as an adventure-seeker. Susan is a writer, photographer, personal trainer, kayak instructor, and outdoor enthusiast. Her tenacious exploration by sea kayak has fueled her stories of the natural world for decades. She's "fifty-something" and plans on habitual escapades from Puget Sound to Alaska well into her nineties. She lives with her second-half-of-life partner, along with a ridiculously large dog, and two normal-sized cats in Oso, Washington.

The tides are not always in her favor and the crossings are not all sun drenched and paddled with ease or certainty. At times her fatigue is as palpable as the taste of salt from tears or sea spray or both. When Susan reaches her goal, the reader will understand there is so much more to a solo endeavor than the physical act of paddling 1,100 miles.</p><p>--Chris Duff, expedition paddler and rower, author, <i>On Celtic Tides</i> and <i>Southern Exposure</i></p><p>"I had the privilege of meeting Susan Conrad before she set out on her journey. Her excitement about the coming venture was contagious. As we said goodbye I was not a little envious of all that lay before her. And she does not disappoint. <i>Inside: One Woman's Journey through the Inside Passage</i> is a singular epic. It is a brave story. One of personal triumph, of heart break, terrifying challenges, soulful introspection and sheer joy. It is also a moving story about the power of friendship. Her words flow off the pages, carrying the reader along on the current of her adventure. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about real adventure, personal challenge and experience, through her evocative writing, the wonders and beauty of the Inside Passage."</p><p> --Milbry Polk, co-author of <i>Women of Discovery</i> and founder of Wings WorldQuest</p><br><br><p>"It's not often that a person possessing the ability to sea kayak the Inside Passage solo is also capable of putting into words the extraordinary mental, physical, and emotional challenges faced daily on this incredible journey. Susan Conrad, author of <i>Inside: One Woman's Journey Through the Inside Passage</i> is one of those people. By skillfully blending sometimes painful memories of her life's trials and tribulations, with stories of the hardships and accomplishments she faced on her 1,100 mile kayaking adventure, she reveals valuable lessons for every outdoor lover seeking to find balance between themselves and nature. The life changing decisions, impassioned frustration, numbing exhaustion, and internal obstacles that we all face on our life's journey are eloquently mirrored here in one woman's Northwest Pacific Coast odyssey."</p><p>--Denis Dwyer, expedition paddler, author of <i>Alone in the Passage: An Explorer's Guide to Sea Kayaking the Inside Passage</i></p><p>"Susan Marie Conrad's new memoir's title, <i>Inside: One Woman's Journey through the Inside Passage</i>, is a bit of a misnomer: it is not a "woman's" book. It's a book for everyone. Conrad's narrative is engaging and unpretentious. She comes across as refreshingly transparent. The book is an easy read. Conrad's memoir isn't just a self-discovery, pull-yourself-up-by-one's-bootstraps story. It's an adventure story and a love story."</p><p>--Robert H. Miller, author of <i>Kayaking the Inside Passage: A Paddler's Guide from Olympia, WA to Muir Glacier, AK</i></p><p>"Susan's mostly solo experience reads like a rite of passage, a personal challenge destined to turn her life around from its gritty beginnings and events she would rather have never experienced to a positive new awakening. I enjoyed reading Susan's second expedition. By 'second' I mean her book about the trip, because I know that writing it must have drawn as much energy, taken as much time and pulled as much on her emotions as the paddling trip itself. She reveals her background; some ghosts she was determined to come to terms with. She reveals her hopes and her fears. She reveals the emotion that spending so long in such an impartial environment invokes. She shows her backbone. Hers is the story of a deliberate passage from one place to another, from one life into another, burying old ghosts and creating the foundations for a happier future."</p><p>--Nigel Foster, kayak designer, instructor and author of numerous books including <i>On Polar Tides</i> and <i>Encounters from a Kayak: Native People, Sacred Places, and Hungry Polar Bears</i>/</p><p></p><p>"Her 1200 mile kayaking expedition from Anacortes to Juneau in 2010 has adventure, introspection, beautiful descriptions and poetic language that capture the imagination and make the pages turn quickly... she's a powerful, courageous woman who happens to be a gifted paddler and a gifted writer."</p><p>--Penny Carter, <i>The Paddler</i>, Fall 2016</p><p>"Magic and gratitude. That's what comes through in Susan Marie Conrad's sea tale of her solo kayak adventure through the Inside Passage from Anacortes, Washington to Juneau, Alaska.... Susan's book is an entertaining, enjoyable read.... In the end, Susan rises to what she calls the 'biggest challenge for all humans', that of becoming comfortable with the conditions of the mind in the face of unfolding reality.... Susan's story takes her individual journey and makes it relevant to the reader on many levels... Inside is magic."</p><p> --Nancy Soares, TsunamiRangers.com</p><br><br><p>"[Susan's] story is an illuminating and inspiring one. She shares both the highlights of her trip and those low moments when the rain seems to last forever and her gear stays soggy and damp. Conrad's writing style is smooth and conversational, and, throughout my reading experience, I felt as though she were personally telling me her story. I enjoyed every minute of this action-packed and exciting memoir. "</p><p>--Jack Magnus, Readers' Favorite</p><p>"Within these pages of eloquent writing and striking photos, readers will sleep to songs of humpback whales, thrill to spectacular scenery, delight in the generosity of strangers, and share in the author's joy as she discovers the courage and the deep gratitude that comes from experiencing the best and the worst of Nature and humanity. This is a book we highly recommend."</p><p> --Chanticleer Book Reviews</p></p><h2>Animal</h2><p>This authoritative volume starts with a clear introduction to the animal world, examining the reasons for the apparently infinite variety of animal forms and the major evolutionary developments. Animal anatomy, life-cycles and the principles of classification are also explored. This is followed by a superbly illustrated survey of world habitats, showing how animals have adapted to each environment and the threats that face both wildlife and plants today. The main part of the book, an up-to-date and comprehensive animal catalogue, looks in detail at each major group and provides absorbing profiles of over 2,000 individual species. Spectacular photographic portraits bring a vast array of animals vividly to life, with special features on well-known and important creatures such as the Galapagos tortoise. Each species profile is supported by maps and symbols showing distribution and habitat, as well as key information on size, population and conservation status, forming a valuable reference database.</p><p>Over 2,000 species, from the tiny spider mite to the massive blue whale, are profiled in DK's astonishingly wonderful <i>Animal</i>, produced in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and more than 70 expert zoologists. To call this book "profusely illustrated" is to seriously underrepresent page after page of breathtaking photos capturing each creature in sharp images, thrumming with life. Even the page borders are covered with collages of animal skins to indicate which class of organisms is represented in that section--every inch of this heavy book is gorgeous.<p> Besides heft and beauty, <i>Animal</i> has authority. Editors-in-chief David Burnie and Don E. Wilson are top biologists, and they have assembled a crack team of consultants for each section of the book. For instance, Richard Rosenblatt of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography takes charge of the chapter on fishes, so all the classification, behavior, and distribution data is up-to-date and full of the kind of detail that comes from years of professional specialization. In addition to basic size, location, and status information, each animal gets a short, one- to two-paragraph description, enough to give a feel for the creature:</p><p> </p><blockquote> The blackfin icefish produces a natural "antifreeze," enabling it to survive in the subzero waters of the Antarctic. It lacks red blood cells and hence looks rather pale, but has excellent blood circulation, and a strong heart which weighs as much as that of a small mammal. Its large, toothy mouth led to it being called the crocodile fish by 19th-century whalers. </blockquote><p> Biodiversity has never been more at the forefront of biologists' concerns, and <i>Animal</i> reports on the issues critical to ecology, from habitat loss to the species that are most endangered within each class. </p><p> This book is an ideal browsing reference for all experience levels, as well as a delightful addition to the collection of any animal enthusiast or classroom. Of necessity, not all species are covered, but as a general source of information down to the genus level, <i>Animal</i> excels. Don't be put off by the price! Extraordinarily beautiful, biologically accurate, and packed with furry, feathery, finny, many-legged delights, <i>Animal</i> is one of the very best science books of 2001. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>David Burnie, Editor-in-Chief has written over 75 nature books and scripted a number of natural history television documentaries for the BBC and other wildlife productions, such as Survival School and Wild Islands. He has won numerous awards including the Science Book Prize for his book How Nature Works.</p><h2>Pagan Time</h2><p>Raised at her family&#39;s commune in the Adirondack wilderness, Perks pens a wrenching and beautiful memoir of an unorthodox childhood and her wildly eccentric father, a self-proclaimed pagan intent on demolishing conventional boundaries and morality.</p><p>It's always a pleasure to read a memoir about the 1960s that doesn't rationalize or recriminate but instead concentrates on conveying the texture of those wild times. Micah Perks's matter-of-fact re-creation of her counterculture childhood makes it clear that living without rules had severe consequences, but she also captures the anarchic pleasures of that life. Perks was 6 weeks old in 1963 when her parents borrowed $20,000 to buy 550 acres of land in the Adirondacks and establish the Valley Commune School. They took in troubled teens referred by the courts and children disabled by mental illness, aiming to help them grow up "free from the suffocating values of mainstream society." "We're changing the established order," her charismatic, feckless father asserted, handing out guns to juvenile delinquents and organizing a "war" between Romans and Celts in which the retreating Romans set fire to a pagan shrine. Micah's best friend, she learned 20 years later, was sexually abused by an older boy and his girlfriend; her father slept with students and virtually any other woman he ran across; in retaliation her mother began an affair with the man who would eventually become her lifelong partner. Readers may well be horrified by the grownups' abdication of responsibility, but Perks herself is unfazed by the vagaries of human nature and seems to bear no grudge, though her adult attitude toward her parents is wary. "That was the best part of my life," she concludes, adding in a properly parenthetical aside: "(best is not quite accurate, but I don't know what other word to use)." Judging by her scrupulous, evenhanded narrative, we can guess that for all the terror and uncertainty she endured, she values her childhood for the intensity and honesty she experienced watching a bunch of principled misfits live their convictions. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Micah Perks is the author of a novel, <i>We Are Gathered Here</i>. She has been twice nominated for a Pushcart Prize and currently lives in Santa Cruz where she teaches at the University of California.</p><h2>Shirley Barber's Fairy Stories (Book &amp; CD)</h2><p>Fairy Stories with CD</p><p></p><h2>Shirley Conran: Three Complete Novels: Lace, Lace 2 and Crimson</h2><p>Passion, glamour, suspense, and sensation blend in a trio of best-selling novels: Lace, Lace II, and Crimson.</p><p></p><h2>200 of the Best Songs from the Swing Era (Jazz Bible Fake Book)</h2><p>(Fake Book).

Then I'll live in squalor in a Bronx tenement, where the toilet is shared by four apartments! My shirts will go unironed, my tie will be perpetually awry. <i>See what you've done to me?"</i></p><p>But when he told Alice about the apartment, she only laughed bitterly and said, "Not anymore, Howard. I won't play those games with you. You win every damn time."</p><p>She pretended not to care about him anymore, but Howard knew better. He knew people, knew what they wanted, and Alice wanted <i>him</i>. It was his strongest card in their relationship--that she wanted him more than he wanted her. He thought of this often: at work in the offices of Humboldt and Breinhardt, Designers; at lunch in a cheap lunchroom (part of the punishment); on the subway home to his tenement (Alice had kept the Lincoln Continental). He thought and thought about how much she wanted him. But he kept remembering what she had said the day she threw him out: If you ever come near Rhiannon again I'll kill you.</p><p>He could not remember why she had said that. Could not remember and did not try to remember because that line of thinking made him uncomfortable and one thing Howard insisted on being was comfortable with himself. Other people could spend hours and days of their lives chasing after some accommodation with themselves, but Howard was accommodated. Well adjusted. At ease. I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK. Hell with you. "If you let them make you feel uncomfortable," Howard would often say, "you give them a handle on you and they can run your life." Howard could find other people's handles, but they could never find Howard's.</p><p>It was not yet winter but cold as hell at three A.M. when Howard got home from Stu's party. A must attend party, if you wished to get ahead at Humboldt and Breinhardt. Stu's ugly wife tried to be tempting, but Howard had played innocent and made her feel so uncomfortable that she dropped the matter. Howard paid careful attention to office gossip and knew that several earlier departures from the company had got caught with, so to speak, their pants down. Not that Howard's pants were an impenetrable barrier. He got Dolores from the front office into the bedroom and accused her of making life miserable for him. "In little ways," he insisted. "I know you don't mean to, but you've got to stop."</p><p>"What ways?" Dolores asked, incredulous yet (because she honestly tried to make other people happy) uncomfortable.</p><p>"Surely you knew how attracted I am to you."</p><p>"No. That hasn't--that hasn't even crossed my mind."</p><p>Howard looked tongue-tied, embarrassed. He actually was neither. "Then--well, then, I was--I was wrong, I'm sorry, I thought you were doing it deliberately--"</p><p>"Doing what?"</p><p>"Snub--snubbing me--never mind, it sounds adolescent, just little things, hell, Dolores, I had a stupid schoolboy crush--"</p><p>"Howard, I didn't even know I was hurting you."</p><p>"God, how insensitive," Howard said, sounding even more hurt.</p><p>"Oh, Howard, do I mean that much to you?"</p><p>Howard made a little whimpering noise that meant everything she wanted it to mean. She looked uncomfortable. She'd do anything to get back to feeling right with herself again. She was so uncomfortable that they spent a rather nice half hour making each other feel comfortable again. No one else in the office had been able to get to Dolores. But Howard could get to anybody.</p><p>He walked up the stairs to his apartment feeling very, very satisfied. Don't need you, Alice, he said to himself. Don't need nobody, and nobody's who I've got. He was still mumbling the little ditty to himself as he went into the communal bathroom and turned on the light.</p><p>He heard a gurgling sound from the toilet stall, a hissing sound. Had someone been in there with the light off? Howard went into the toilet stall and saw nobody. Then looked closer and saw a baby, probably about two months old, lying in the toilet bowl. Its nose and eyes were barely above the water; it looked terrified, its legs and hips and stomach were down the drain. Someone had obviously hoped to kill it by drowning--it was inconceivable to Howard that anyone could be so moronic as to think it would fit down the drain.</p><p>For a moment he thought of leaving it there, with the big-city temptation to mind one's own business even when to do so would be an atrocity. Saving this baby would mean inconvenience: calling the police, taking care of the child in his apartment, perhaps even headlines, certainly a night of filling out reports. Howard was tired. Howard wanted to go to bed.</p><p>But he remembered Alice saying, "You aren't even human, Howard. You're a goddam selfish monster." I am not a monster, he answered silently, and reached down into the toilet bowl to pull the child out.</p><p>The baby was firmly jammed in--whoever had tried to kill it had meant to catch it tight. Howard felt a brief surge of genuine indignation that anyone could think to solve his problems by killing an innocent child. But thinking of crimes committed on children was something Howard was determined not to do, and besides, at that moment he suddenly acquired other things to think about.</p><p>As the child clutched at Howard's arm, he noticed the baby's fingers were fused together into flipperlike flaps of bone and skin at the end of the arm. Yet the flippers gripped his arms with an unusual strength as, with two hands deep in the toilet bowl, Howard tried to pull the baby free.</p><p>At last, with a gush, the child came up and the water finished its flushing action. The legs, too, were fused into a single limb that was hideously twisted at the end. The child was male; the genitals, larger than normal, were skewed off to one side. And Howard noticed that where the feet should be were two more flippers, and near the tips were red spots that looked like putrefying sores. The child cried, a savage mewling that reminded Howard of a dog he had seen in its death throes. (Howard refused to be reminded that it had been he who killed the dog by throwing it out in the street in front of a passing car, just to watch the driver swerve; the driver hadn't swerved.)</p><p>Even the hideously deformed have a right to live, Howard thought, but now, holding the child in his arms, he felt a revulsion that translated into sympathy for whoever, probably the parents, had tried to kill the creature. The child shifted its grip on him, and where the flippers had been Howard felt a sharp, stinging pain that quickly turned to agony as it was exposed to the air. Several huge, gaping sores on his arm were already running with blood and pus.</p><p>It took a moment for Howard to connect the sores with the child, and by then the leg flippers were already pressed against his stomach, and the arm flippers already gripped his chest. The sores on the child's flippers were not sores; they were powerful suction devices that gripped Howard's skin so tightly that it ripped away when the contact was broken. He tried to pry the child off, but no sooner was one flipper free than it found a new place to hold even as Howard struggled to break the grip of another.</p><p>What had begun as an act of charity had now become an intense struggle. This was not a child, Howard realized. Children could not hang on so tightly, and the creature had teeth that snapped at his hands and arms whenever they came near enough. A human face, certainly, but not a human being. Howard threw himself against the wall, hoping to stun the creature so it would drop away. It only clung tighter, and the sores where it hung on him hurt more. But at last Howard pried and scraped it off by levering it against the edge of the toilet stall. It dropped to the ground, and Harold backed quickly away, on fire with the pain of a dozen or more stinging wounds.</p><p>It had to be a nightmare. In the middle of the night, in a bathroom lighted by a single bulb, with a travesty of humanity writhing on the floor, Howard could not believe that it had any reality.</p><p>Could it be a mutation that had somehow lived? Yet the thing had far more purpose, far more control of its body than any human infant. The baby slithered across the floor as Howard, in pain from the wounds on his body, watched in a panic of indecision. The baby reached the wall and cast a flipper onto it. The suction held and the baby began to inch its way straight up the wall. As it climbed, it defecated, a thin drool of green tracing down the wall behind it. Howard looked at the slime following the infant up the wall, looked at the pus-covered sores on his arms.</p><p>What if the animal, whatever it was, did not die soon of its terrible deformity? What if it lived? What if it were found, taken to a hospital, cared for? What if it became an adult?</p><p>It reached the ceiling and made the turn, clinging tightly to the plaster, not falling off as it hung upside down and inched across toward the light bulb.</p><p>The thing was trying to get directly over Howard, and the defecation was still dripping. Loathing overcame fear, and Howard reached up, took hold of the baby from the back, and, using his full weight, was finally able to pry it off the ceiling. It writhed and twisted in his hands, trying to get the suction cups on him, but Howard resisted with all his strength and was able to get the baby, this time headfirst, into the toilet bowl. He held it there until the bubbles stopped and it was blue. Then he went back to his apartment for a knife. Whatever the creature was, it had to disappear from the face of the earth. It had to die, and there had to be no sign left that could hint that Howard had killed it.</p><p>He found the knife quickly, but paused for a few moments to put something on his wounds. They stung bitterly, but in a while they felt better. Howard took off his shirt; thought a moment and took off all his clothes, then put on his bathrobe and took a towel with him as he returned to the bathroom. He didn't want to get any blood o...</p></p><h2>When Snowflakes Fall</h2><p>This beautiful board book is written and photographed by the authors of the best-selling &#34;In the Woods&#34; children&#39;s picture book series.

From 1994 to 2000 he coproduced, cowrote, and scored a series of award-winning experimental films. Kristian Manchester, also based in Montreal, is an art director with the Diesel design firm.In 1984, native Quebecois Guy Lalibert� decided to turn his annual street performance festival into a traveling troupe. Though the troupe originally planned to perform for only one year as part of the 450th anniversary celebration of French explorer Jacques Cartier&#x2019;s discovery of Canada, it took on a life of its own and has since drawn crowds in major cities all over the world. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine that a company known for its amazing acrobatics and pyrotechnics started out as a loose band of stilt-walkers and fire-breathers, but this elaborate retrospective has the pictures to prove it, as well as interviews offering insight into the exotic world under the big top. The book traces Cirque du Soleil&#x2019;s history in almost excessive detail; the first section, in particular, is an exhaustive record of all the work it took to get the project going. The chapters that follow describe, largely in the words of company members, each show Cirque du Soleil has produced, from the concepts that inspired them to the props used in their realization. In a chapter on the production of "Quidam," for instance, director Franco Dragone talks about how he wanted "to move away from the more fantastic textures of Cirque&#x2019;s previous shows... and get back to the feeling of uncertainty and danger" that once motivated the troupe, and costume designer Dominque Lemieux discusses the influence that artists Delveaux and Magritte had on her designs. The photos are brilliant, capturing both the inner-workings of the various troupes and the grandeur and mystique of the performances themselves. Though still pictures and text will never match the magic of a live show, this is a fascinating look at a group that has captured imaginations around the world.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And nothing has so divided posterity. This short book provides a crisp and lucid narrative of the complicated events of 1640 to 1660 - not just the war between King and Parliament of 1642-46 but the second civil war, the execution of King Charles I, the Commonwealth and the rule of Cromwell, and finally the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. But it also gets behind the preoccupations of later generations and explains what contemporaries on both sides thought they were fighting for and against. Many factors played a part in these wars: the European conflicts of the time; the wars in Scotland and Ireland from which the English conflict emerged; constitutional tussles from the Tudor period; ideas of liberty and reform; the new powers of taxation acquired by parliamentarians; and the collapse of political censorship during the wars. Through it all there ran the conflict of religion. This wonderfully readable and well-informed account stresses the unpredictability not only of the military outcomes but also of the longer-term results. As the author notes, &#39;There is no better illustration of the law of unintended consequences than the English civil wars.&#39;</p><p>Blair Worden has taught at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Sussex and Chicago.

Janovy (Fields of Friendly Strife, 1987; Back in Keith County, 1981, etc.) is invited by a biologist friend on a student expedition to this little-populated Mexican peninsula covered with cardon deserts, granite mountains, and whales breeding offshore. Along his way, he discusses cardons--the giant cacti that make up veritable forests; rock pelicans--the ``bird whose beak can hold more than his belly can''; and a hermit named Mike, who abandoned his business to live in a mountaintop cave. Janovy is absorbing when he sticks to the concrete, but more often he indulges in relentless free association, strained analogies, and paragraphs that end in watery wisdom. While changing planes, for instance, he ruminates that in a hour he will be over Utah, ``geologists' airspace''; that ``pilgrimages seem to be almost instinctive''; that ``humans retain the influence of the geophysical habitat in which they pass their formative years''; and that ``through such returnings we find our who we are.'' Watching a brown pelican, Janovy gives an interesting discussion of the bird's habits, its place in the family of water birds, and a comely description of the bird diving into the sea. As with so many of Janovy's subjects, though, ``...the pelican becomes a metaphor instead of a bird,'' as Janovy explains how ``adjusting my `search image' allows me to see the hidden components of a scene'' and that ``we can test our higher levels of vision by learning how to observe pelicans....'' Would a chicken do in a pinch? Stouthearted readers may be able to stalk Janovy's cognitions through his forest of verbiage; for others, the trek will be arduous and the reward nebulous. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Janovy (biology, Univ. of Nebraska) describes a journey to Baja California in search of the landscape described in John Steinbeck's Sea of Cortez . Along the way he muses on the changing nature of scientific research in the 1990s, noting that most of it has become a scramble for bio-tech dollars conducted in areas chosen to garner grant money and patents rather than based on personal interest. Besides describing Baja's natural history, Janovy explores topics ranging from a biologist's place in society to the effects of population and information explosions. This work transcends the traditional "field study" by examining how modern pressures have changed scientists and their research.

He&#39; written several children&#39;s books for Accord and other publishers under this and other names.Today many picture books are published which have beautiful illustrations, but the text is weird or written above the level of the youngest readers. Not The Adventures of Max the Minnow given to me by my second grade student, Kyle. He knew I would have the giggles for days to come! What enhances the humorous illustrations are two tightly secured wobbling eyeballs which fit from cover to cover causing everyone to laugh at each turn of the page. This story is about a tiny minnow who yearns to be a big fish: "'Maybe I can puff up, too!"/ Max told his seahorse, Sam./ "If I can't be big naturally,/ I'll EAT until I am.'" Then Max gorges on plankton shakes at Saltfish Malts, pizzas at Pizza Cove, pasta at Noodle Hut, and almost gets eaten himself at Sharky's Dinner, which Max thinks should be spelled "Sharky's Diner." But Max becomes too fat and slow until he learns: "That "Big Fish" aren't just made./ It's what you do with what you've got,/ That helps you make the grade./ And Max has lost the weight he gained,/ As you and I can witness. For he's become the biggest fish,/ in underwater fitness!" Librarians and teachers will appreciate the inclusion of a picture glossary about each species of sea life mentioned in the text. This is the third in the series of eyeball animation books which also includes Mystery in Bugtown and Ten Little Dinosaurs. Their newest title Friends of a Feather will be available this June.

Arguably the greatest of the German Expressionists, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner&#x2019;s numerous paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings are loved for their bold colors and dynamics. An admirer of Albrecht D�rer&#x2019;s woodcuts, Kirchner sought to revitalize the technique for his generation, using a pictorial vocabulary that inspired other Expressionists. This volume presents one of Kirchner&#x2019;s most important woodcuts series, based on the legend of Faust. Carved during a stay in a sanatorium near Frankfurt, these woodcuts reflect Kirchner&#x2019;s own tortuous emotions as he tells the story of a man who sells his shadow to the devil. This gorgeous edition features several foldout pages that allow readers to compare and contrast each full-page segment. This book also explores Kirchner&#x2019;s innovative printmaking technique, which involved sawed up plates stained in monotype style. Essays by Kirchner scholars discuss the series&#x2019;s vital contribution to the artist&#x2019;s oeuvre, while exploring his extraordinary use of color, line, and shape to tell a story that is at once universal and highly personal.</p><p>MAGDALENA M.

He is as famous in Japan and the East as he is in Europe and America, not only as an artist-craftsman but also as a thinker. His interpretation of the traditions of the Orient in the making of pots - and thereby evolving a philosophy of life - has set the pace for many potters in the West. Beyond East and West is more than an autobiography. It contains much of Leach&#39;s deeper thought and much about the practical application of his ideas, reproducing, as it does, some of his most significant writings. Its recurrent theme is the meeting of East and West at all levels - artistic, cultural, social, political. Leach first went to Japan as a young man in 1909 and stayed in the East eleven years. He has returned again and again. His experiences in Japan, Korea and China are alive and immediate. There are also chapters on the successful development of the St. Ives pottery and on his other travels which have included North and South America, Australia and New Zealand as well as Europe. &#39;All my life I have been a courier between East and West,&#39; he writes. This important and engrossing book, which is full of sharply-etched and amusing recollections, culminates in the expression of a profound belief in the spiritual unification of man.</p><p>Bernard Leach (1887-1979) was one of the most influential figures in twentieth-century pottery. Born in Hong Kong and brought up in Japan, Hong Kong and England, he trained at the London School of Art and moved to Japan in 1909, where he studied pottery techniques. In 1920 on his return to England he founded the Leach Pottery with Shoji Hamada in St Ives, Cornwall. His best-known work, A Potter&#39;s Book, was first published in 1940.</p><h2>Perry Mason in the Case of the Burning Bequest: Based on Characters Created by Erle Stanley Gardner</h2><p>When the body of Anne&#39;s stepmother is found by John Leland, whose marriage to Anne she had opposed, in the same room that Anne&#39;s mother was murdered in twenty years earlier, Mason&#39;s new case begins</p><p>Repeating his successful continuation of the work of the late Erle Stanley Gardner, MWA president Chastain invents a second mystery to challenge lawyer Perry Mason ( The Case of Too Many Murders ). John Leland is arrested for fatally stabbing Iris Jantzen, stepmother of his fiancee, Anne Kimbro, who engages Mason to save her beloved. With Della Street and Paul Drake, the attorney searches for facts to refute the mass of evidence against Leland. But information about an earlier murder in the same house where Iris was killed further incriminates the accused, who repeatedly disappears while shrewd Mason, preparing for the trial, looks elsewhere for a suspect. Will the great lawyer crush the opposition at the height of the courtroom proceedings? Of course. Chastain adheres to Gardner's successful formula in which the fun comes from guessing how--not if--Perry will win his daunting cases.

Travelling to the old, cloistered institution ofCarneSchool, Smiley discovers that neither the very respectable people of the school nor the murder are as straightforward as they appear. A Murder of Quality is an ingenious mystery -- with all of le Carre&#39;s unmatched skill for deft plotting -- and a wry, intelligent commentary on class warfare of a particularly bloody kind.</p><p><b>John le Carr�</b> is the nom de plume of David John Moore Cornwell, who was born in 1931 in Poole, Dorset and educated at Sherborne School, the University of Berne (where he studied German literature for a year) and at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first-class degree in modern languages. He taught at Eton from 1956 to 1958 and was a member of the British Foreign Service from 1959 to 1964, serving first as Second Secretary in the British Embassy in Bonn and subsequently as political consul in Hamburg. His first novel, a story of espionage called <i>Call for the Dead</i>, was published in 1961. It was quickly followed in 1962 by <i>A Murder of Quality</i>, a mystery story set in an English public school. His third novel, <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</i>, secured him a wide reputation, and was made into a successful film starring Richard Burton. This was followed by <i>The Looking Glass War, A Small Town in Germany</i> and <i>The Naive and Sentimental Lover</i>. However, the success of his third novel was consolidated by the acclaim for his trilogy <i>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy </i>and <i>Smiley's People</i>. Next came <i>The Little Drummer Girl</i>, which was a departure from the Smiley novels, and dealt with the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East. This was followed by his most autobiographical novel, <i>A Perfect Spy</i>. Then came <i>The Russia House, The Secret Pilgrim, The Night Manager, Our Game, The Tailor of Panama, Single &amp; Single, The Constant Gardener, Absolute Friends, The Mission Song and A Delicate Truth</i>. As well as <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</i>, many other le Carr� novels have been made into films or television series. Alec Guinness starred as George Smiley in the TV mini-series of <i>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</i> and <i>Smiley's People</i>, while Denholm Elliott took on the role for <i>A Murder of Quality</i>. The 2011 remake of <i>Tinker Tailor</i> <i>Soldier Spy</i> starred Gary Oldman as Smiley, and featured a stellar cast including Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch. <i>A Most Wanted Man</i> (2013) starred Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his last roles, and 2014 saw the release of<i> Our Kind of Traitor</i>, featuring Ewan McGregor, Damian Lewis and Naomie Harris. David Cornwell has won many prestigious prizes and awards for his novels over the years.

But Carne prefers the respectability of the monarch to the questionable politics of his adviser, drawing strength from the conviction that Great Schools, like Tudor Kings, were ordained in Heaven.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And indeed its greatness is little short of miraculous. Founded by obscure monks, endowed by a sickly boy king, and dragged from oblivion by a Victorian bully, Carne had straightened its collar, scrubbed its rustic hands and face and presented itself shining to the courts of the twentieth century. And in the twinkling of an eye, the Dorset bumpkin was London's darling: Dick Whittington had arrived. Carne had parchments in Latin, seals in wax, and Lammas Land behind the Abbey. Carne had property, cloisters and woodworm, a whipping block and a line in the Doomsday Book -- then what more did it need to instruct the sons of the rich?</p><p></p><p></p><p>And they came; each Half they came (for terms are not elegant things), so that throughout a whole afternoon the trains would unload sad groups of black-coated boys on to the station platform. They came in great cars that shone with mournful purity. They came to bury poor King Edward, trundling handcarts over the cobbled streets or carrying tuck boxes like little coffins. Some wore gowns, and when they walked they looked like crows, or black angels come for the burying. Some followed singly like undertakers' mutes, and you could hear the clip of their boots as they went. They were always in mourning at Carne; the small boys because they must stay and the big boys because they must leave, the masters because respectability was underpaid; and now, as the Lent Half (as the Easter term was called) drew to its end, the cloud of gloom was as firmly settled as ever over the grey towers of Carne.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Gloom and the cold. The cold was crisp and sharp as flint. It cut the faces of the boys as they moved slowly from the deserted playing fields after the school match. It pierced their black topcoats and turned their stiff, pointed collars into icy rings round their necks. Frozen, they plodded from the field to the long walled road which led to the main tuck shop and the town, the line gradually dwindling into groups, and the groups into pairs. Two boys who looked even colder than the rest crossed the road and made their way along a narrow path which led towards a distant but less populated tuck shop.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I think I shall die if ever I have to watch one of those beastly rugger games again. The noise is fantastic," said one. He was tall with fair hair, and his name was Caley.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"People only shout because the dons are watching from the pavilion," the other rejoined; "that's why each house has to stand together. So that the house dons can swank about how loud their houses shout."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"What about Rode?" asked Caley. "Why does he stand with us and make us shout, then? He's not a house don, just a bloody usher."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"He's sucking up to house dons all the time. You can see him in the quad between lessons buzzing round the big men. All the junior masters do." Caley's companion was a cynical red-haired boy called Perkins, Captain of Fielding's house.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I've been to tea with Rode," said Caley.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Rode's hell. He wears brown boots. What was tea like?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Bleak. Funny how tea gives them away. Mrs. Rode's quite decent, though -- homely in a plebby sort of way: doyleys and china birds. Food's good: Women's Institute, but good."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Rode's doing Corps next Half. That'll put the lid on it. He's so keen, bouncing about all the time. You can tell he's not a gentleman. You know where he went to school?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Branxome Grammar. Fielding told my Mama, when she came over from Singapore last Half."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"God. Where's Branxome?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"On the coast. Near Bournemouth. I haven't been to tea with anyone except Fielding." Perkins added after a slight pause, "You get roast chestnuts and crumpets. You're never allowed to thank him, you know. He says emotionalism is only for the lower classes. That's typical of Fielding. He's not like a don at all. I think boys bore him. The whole house goes to tea with him once a Half, he has us in turn, four at a time, and that's about the only time he talks to most men."</p><p></p><p></p><p>They walked on in silence for a while until Perkins said:</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Fielding's giving another dinner party tonight."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"He's pushing the boat out these days," Caley replied, with disapproval. "Suppose the food in your house is worse than ever?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"It's his last Half before he retires. He's entertaining every don and all the wives separately by the end of the Half. Black candles every evening. For mourning. Hells extravagant."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Yes. I suppose it's a sort of gesture."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"My Pater says he's a queer."</p><p></p><p></p><p>They crossed the road and disappeared into the tuck shop, where they continued to discuss the weighty affairs of Mr. Terence Fielding, until Perkins drew their meeting reluctantly to a close. Being a poor hand at science, he was unfortunately obliged to take extra tuition in the subject.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The dinner party to which Perkins had alluded that afternoon was now drawing to a close. Mr. Terence Fielding, senior housemaster of Carne, gave himself some more port and pushed the decanter wearily to his left. It was his port, the best he had. There was enough of the best to last the Half -- and after that, be damned. He felt a little tired after watching the match, and a little drunk, and a little bored with Shane Hecht and her husband. Shane was so hideous. Massive and enveloping, like a faded Valkyrie. All that black hair. He should have asked someone else. The Snows for instance, but he was too clever. Or Felix D'Arcy, but D'Arcy interrupted. Ah well, a little later he would annoy Charles Hecht, and Hecht would get in a pet and leave early.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hecht was fidgeting, wanting to light his pipe, but Fielding damn well wouldn't have it. Hecht could have a cigar if he wanted to smoke. But his pipe could stay in his dinner-jacket pocket, where it belonged, or didn't belong, and his athletic profile could remain unadorned.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Cigar, Hecht?"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"No thanks, Fielding. I say, do you mind if I...''</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I can recommend the cigars. Young Havelake sent them from Havana. His father's ambassador there, you know."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Yes, dear," said Shane tolerantly; "Vivian Havelake was in Charles's troop when Charles was commandant of the Cadets."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Good boy, Havelake," Hecht observed, and pressed his lips together to show he was a strict judge.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"It's amusing how things have changed." Shane Hecht said this rapidly with a rather wooden smile, as if it weren't really amusing. "Such a grey world we live in, now.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I remember before the war when Charles inspected the Corps on a white horse. We don't do that kind of thing now, do we? I've got nothing against Mr. Iredale as commandant, nothing at all. What was his regiment, Terence, do you know? I'm sure he does it very nicely, whatever they do now in the Corps -- he gets on so well with the boys, doesn't he? His wife's such a nice person...I wonder why they can never keep their servants. I hear Mr. Rode will be helping out with the Corps next Half."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Poor little Rode," said Fielding slowly; "running about like a puppy, trying to earn his biscuits. He tries so hard; have you seen him cheering at school matches? He'd never seen a game of rugger before he came here, you know. They don't play rugger at grammar schools -- it's all soccer. Do you remember when he first came, Charles? It was fascinating. He lay very low at first, drinking us in: the games, the vocabulary, the manners. Then, one day it was as if he had been given the power of speech, and he spoke in our language. It was amazing, like plastic surgery. It was Felix D'Arcy's work of course -- I've never seen anything quite like it before."</p><p></p><p></p><p>"Dear Mrs. Rode," said Shane Hecht in that voice of abstract vagueness which she reserved for her most venomous pronouncements: "So sweet...and such simple taste, don't you think? I me...</p></p><h2>Bird Life in Wington: Practical Parables for Young People</h2><p>A collection of sermons about the (bird) characters belonging to the First Birderian Church of Wington, aimed at stimulating the interest of young people in the worship services of the church.</p><p></p><h2>Heartache and Healing: Coming to Terms With Grief</h2><p>Book by Yeagley, Larry</p><p></p><h2>Exploring the 46 Adirondack High Peaks: With 282 Photos, Maps &amp; Mountain Profiles, Excerpts from the Author's Journal, &amp; Historical Insights</h2><p>The author documents in detail how he planned and climbed the peaks, starting with his older son, then with his younger son.

It is China in the 1940s, and Saihung is continuing his study of esoteric Taoism, first as a student at Huashan monastery, then as a martial arts practitioner and actor in Chinese Opera, and finally as disciple of two accomplished masters. The exotic language and action immediately bring to mind Lobsang Rampa and Carlos Castaneda but, despite that caveat, there is much here that serious martial arts devotees will find absorbing. Students of Chinese philosophy will be less keen.

Before being declared a national treasure by President Ronald Reagan, Williams would chart eighteen gold and three platinum albums, headline at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for more than twenty years, and host an enormously popular weekly television variety show whose Christmas specials still occupy a tender spot in every baby boomer&#x2019;s heart.<br><br> Williams knew everybody who was anybody during his seven remarkable decades in show business (including Judy Garland, John Huston, Jack Lemmon, John Lennon, Elton John, Frank Sinatra, Elvis, and Barbra Streisand, among others) and was a close friend of Bobby Kennedy for many years, and he shares memories of them all in <i>Moon River and Me</i>.

Known as the King of Hearts, the Emperor of Easy, and Mr. Moon River, he divides his time between La Quinta, California, and Branson, Missouri. <p> </p> <p> </p>Andy Williams is an all-around-nice-guy--known as much for his sweaters as his smooth singing. His memoir takes nothing away from that image; it just reinforces that the real Andy Williams is a lot like the guy we watched on TV every week from 1959 to 1971. Williams narrates himself, and if he slips up on a few words or occasionally pauses in mid-sentence, it can be forgiven. After all, he&#39;s now in his 80s (and still performs at his own theater in Branson, Missouri). Many aspects of his life are fascinating--he talks in heartbreaking detail about being at Bobby Kennedy&#39;s side when he was assassinated. He talks about the trial of his ex-wife, Claudine Longet, for the shooting death of her lover. He talks about his tough early years and his rise to television fame. But mainly he talks about his love of music. It&#39;s wider than a mile. M.S. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>A Question of Truth: Christianity and Homosexuality</h2><p><p>Many Christians accept that 'homosexual acts are wrong' on the authority of the Church. For many others such teaching contradicts what they know to be the obvious truth. In this book Gareth Moore closely and dispassionately examines the bases of Christian 'anti-gay' arguments. Moore critically explores the language that we use to describe and define human sexuality and what this means for what we think we know about sex, identity and morality.At the centre of this work is a thorough and revolutionary analysis of the Bible on homosexuality posing such questions as: Is there a unified biblical teaching on sex or homosexuality? Are we misreading the Bible by applying modern thinking and terms? Must Christians accept Paul's supposed rejection of homosexuality when they do not follow all of his teaching (for example his low estimation of marriage - 1, Cor, 7)?For Moore the criticism that gay practice is remote from Christian values is just as true of straight life. Gay Christians are often responsible and thoughtful moral agents and to propose otherwise is both unreasonable and deeply disrespectful. It is a precondition of being heard that we listen and in the end the gospel can only be preached effectively by those who listen.</p></p><p>Gareth Moore is a member of the Dominican Order and has taught at Blackfriars, Oxford (England). He is the author of Believing in God and Question of Truth: Christianity and Homosexuality (Continuum)."Moore admits his book brings together what others have already said, but his original contribution is to apply a conceptual and linguistic analysis to this discussion. He is also an excellent pedagogue who uses examples and analogies to clarify his arguments...this is an important book published at a time when many Christians are again publicly discussing homosexuality. " -Charles Curran, The Tablet<br><br>"...this work is exhaustive, examining the both the biblical and natural law foundations of Catholic doctrine...Recommended. Lower level undergraduates and above." -CHOICE, Jan. 2004<br><br>&#x201c;...he has paved the way for others to write positively of Christianity and homosexuality, freed from the need to answer Vatican pronouncements. A Question of Truth has left those decrees in ruins. This book is a must-read for anyone serious about homosexuality and religion.&#x201d; &#x2013;Lambda Book Report, November/December 2004</p><h2>Reference Guide for Essential Oils, 2017 Edition, Softcover</h2><p><p>Higley Reference Guide for Essential Oils (Desk Copy)</p><p>About the Product</p><ul><li>This new, full-color edition is completely redesigned and expanded with the latest products and product ingredients.
